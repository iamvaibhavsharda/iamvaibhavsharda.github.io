								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>Hamilton Beach TrueAir Review 2019</h1>
<p>A compact model with relatively poor performance without replacement functions to compensate for this.</p>
<p>The biggest question is: how healthy is this Hamilton Beach air purifier for your air? Clean air is vital for the health of asthma and allergy sufferers. I will not give you all the subtleties of the impact of allergens on asthma sufferers, as you no doubt already know. In fact, that&#8217;s probably why you&#8217;re here.</p>
<p>You already understand that coughing, whining, tight lungs and coughing are symptoms of inhaling polluted air (which can be embarrassing for all concerned).</p>
<p>Let’s get into the good stuff – the nitty-gritty of an air purifier by Hamilton Beach – the TrueAir Allergen-Reducing Air Purifier 04383A.</p>
<p>Hamilton Beach Appliances has been active since 1910 and offers a wide range of products. You may be more familiar with their many devices and food producers (ice cream, popcorn, bread, pasta&#8230;I get lost). They have excellent air-purifying gadgets, such as the Hamilton Beach True Air Odor Eliminator fragrance cleaner with pilot light.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re tall in air cleaners and filtration (I mean, it&#8217;s not?) you&#8217;re aware of TrueAir, under Hamilton Beach documented brands. Under this brand they sell air cleaners, deodorizers and extra parts and filters.</p>
<p>But back in the 04383 air purifier. There is much to discuss with this particular creature that purifies the air, because in addition to a number of intriguing consumer comments, there are a number of other interesting features&#8230;..to consider.</p>
<h2>Our analysis and evaluation results</h2>
<p>The Hamilton Beach TrueAir is a bad performer and costs more than other compact models in the very long run, making it a bad choice for the majority of users.</p>
<h2>Performance Comparison</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you can see in the table above, the Hamilton Beach TrueAir was the worst public awareness of our tests. For more information on why he got such a low score, read the paragraphs below. In all our unique evaluations, we go into detail about the results achieved.</p>
<p>The general evaluation of Hamilton Beach TrueAir 04383 is largely based on the way the model eliminated dust and smoke from a test area, as well as the noise level of the air purifiers.</p>
<p>Dust, pollen and smoke removal: Because mannequins remove fine clay and cigarette smoke from the air, the performance of laptops is at its highest and lowest speed. Those who felt good about dust removal should have a comparable pollen yield.</p>
<p>Noise: Based on tool measurement using a portable model that operates at the highest and lowest speeds.</p>
<h2>Performance of the air purifier</h2>
<p>Hamilton Beach TrueAir was one of the worst players in our air cleaning tests, sharing the barrel base with an extra model. We place it for one hour in our smoke-filled test chamber and it reduces the concentration of airborne particles by 89.49%. By comparison, the most efficient compact model (GermGuardian AC4100) achieved a 95.32% drop, and most full-size models managed to break 99%. That&#8217;s why TrueAir will make the air purifier, but you can also find other similar models that can do much better. Moreover, it is the only model we examined that does not define a CADR (Clean Air Delivery Rate), but we also assume that it would be about 60 or even 70, which means that it is powerful enough for spaces under 100 square meters.</p>
<p>In our compact conflict cleaners, the Hamilton Beach TrueAir was in the back of the backpack, hampered by poor air cleaning performance, fragile controls and expensive filters. If you are looking for a compact cleaner for a small space, we recommend the GermGuardian AC4100. It is more effective in cleaning the air and is cheaper in the long run.</p>
<p>Relatively poor area for Hamilton Beach TrueAir 04384, which is only suitable for a small room. Again, no official statistics have been published for Hamilton Beach TrueAir 04384 CADR, but our internal evaluation shows that it performs below average, which is not surprising since this air purifier, which really reduces allergens, is designed for.</p>
<h2>CADR</h2>
<p>The manufacturer explains nothing about CADR, but I discovered it on CADR Online Quotes from 40-50. All this is estimated because the filtration system is not good enough to produce dimensions for small particles and therefore probably does not qualify for CADR. If we then take the CADR 50, with the recommended room size of 160 square feet and a ceiling height of 8 feet, the device produces 1280 cubic feet per second. 1280/50 = 25 minutes. I think a complete change of air in the room twice in an hour is very bad.</p>
<p>The powerful HEPA filter system captures air particles from 3 microns. It will also make the air 99p. 100 cleaner than for use. This device is usually designed to remove odors and scales from pets, but it has also been proven to remove specific allergens from the air.</p>

<h2>Noise</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The sound produced by this TrueAir during our tests was relatively low, giving it a higher score than the average of 7 out of 10. The TrueAir is one of the most common sound-generating devices in the world. In height, it produces a very low hum that will probably disappear into the background after a few minutes of jogging, but is still a bit more striking than that of Coway. At a moderate level, this humming is quieter but still perceptible. At reduced, buzzing is very quiet and barely perceptible, much rest before reading or meditating.</p>
<p>The two things that people are looking for when you buy an air purifier are now the main features of this device. No one wants a noisy air purifier that can distract you from your daily tasks, which is why the Hamilton Beach Cleaner is specially designed to be very quiet when cleaning the air and has a compact design that you can install almost anywhere. Having a large and strong cleaner is never good, especially since you are limited in the space in which it can be placed.</p>
<p>The low position is hardly noticeable. The central setting is also quiet and can be used during sleep. The highest setting is not very noisy but disturbs your sleep. Overall, I can really say that the noise is not annoying.</p>
<p>Comes in a modern white ABS plastic case, Hamilton Beach TrueAir 04384 is well built even if it won&#8217;t hit you like a superior outdoor air purifier. In a very small and light enclosure, Hamilton Beach TrueAir 04384, thanks to its flexible design, can be placed vertically or horizontally, depending on the distance you need, you can place it from the table, cabinet, shelf or perhaps even the floor with maximum airflow efficiency. On the top and front flaps there is a manual adjustment knob, which can be removed from the outside to clean the permanent HEPA filter.</p>
<h2>Ease of use</h2>
<p>The Hamilton Beach TrueAir rating of 4 out of 10 was the lowest of all the tests performed as part of our usability test. It has only three fan speeds with no shutdown timer, which limits its configurability and increases the risk of you accidentally leaving it on all day while in the office. What&#8217;s more, the unique rotary knob he uses because of its control panel looks soft and inexpensive, as it can break if you&#8217;re not soft with it. In the plus column it weighs only 4.9 pounds, so it is very easy to move.</p>
<p>As the name suggests, this cleaner focuses mainly on allergens and allergy-related air problems.</p>
<p>TrueAir includes a three-stage filtration process:</p>
<p>1) A pre-filter, to capture larger particles such as hair and dust.</p>
<p>(2) Two charcoal filters, which treat light odours (such as &#8216;odour trap&#8217; and &#8216;wet dog smell&#8217;).</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>A HEPA filter designed to collect smaller particles up to 0.3 microns.</li>
</ol>
<p>According to the manufacturer, this device has an area of approximately 140 square meters, or a space of approximately 12 feet x 12 feet. As we say in many of our air purification reviews, the producer tends to quote on the high side. In such cases, I think that this amount is a little generous and should be lower; TrueAir is really designed to do better in small bedrooms (90 &#8212; 120 square feet; or about a 10&#8242; x 10&#8242; room).</p>
<p>As you can understand, air purifiers are sometimes difficult to install, especially when you are dealing with an air filter replacement. As if by chance, this device has been designed to be very user-friendly and doesn&#8217;t take a lot of time to set up. If you take it out of the box, it will be ready for use in a few minutes. After the first two days of use, we recommend vacuuming your filter. Then every 3 to 6 weeks.</p>
<p>In small bedrooms the unit works almost as well as you would expect from a cheap air purifier. It satisfactorily reduces dust levels, and you&#8217;ll probably notice a difference in the total amount of animal hair on your own floor &#8211; although TrueAir certainly leaves some support (TrueAir isn&#8217;t powerful enough to get everything, and your prefilter won&#8217;t be high enough).</p>
<p>(Note: I was a bit surprised that this device was a fake HEPA air purifier; however, not all HEPA filters are made equal, and this device is no exception &#8211; it&#8217;s just not that powerful.)</p>
<p>When it comes to scents, TrueAir will alleviate some common pet scents &#8211; but it will leave many supportive scents behind; it does almost nothing when it comes to chemical scents or cigarette smoke (to be expected &#8211; you need powerful charcoal filters to handle stubborn odours, and TrueAir charcoal filters are quite light).</p>
<p>Hamilton Beach 04383A is a very small air purifier. It looks like a speaker in white or black.</p>

<p>The dimensions are:</p>
<p>Depth 8.5 in / 21.5 cm</p>
<p>Width 6&#8243; / 15 cm</p>
<p>Height 13,5 in / 34cm</p>
<p>The best place for this is somewhere on a shelf or table. For the user&#8217;s convenience, this device can be placed horizontally and vertically.</p>
<p>It won&#8217;t break your board because its weight is only 2.6 kg (5.7 lbs).</p>
<h2>Operating costs</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even with a very low purchase price of 80 dollars for the device, the Hamilton Beach TrueAir is surprisingly expensive in the long run. The estimated lifetime cost is $573, which is higher than that of the Coway, as well as that of the GermGuardian AC4825, which is each much more powerful and efficient. These high costs are mainly due to the short life of the filters, which operate at $22 and need to be replaced every 90 days. These costs are easily incurred if you use this TrueAir frequently. In addition, it consumes more than average electricity, representing an estimated annual electricity cost of 10.51 dollars.</p>
<p>Hamilton Beach TrueAir Compact Pet 04384 is the most expensive unit in its own compact TrueAir range, although we find it hardly expensive. Not only does the air purifier have an attractive price advantage, but there are also very few annual maintenance costs for maintaining the filter on its own double carbon filters. Hamilton Beach TrueAir Compact Pet 04384 is perhaps not the best air purifier for pets on the market today, it can do its job provided the price of its own in.</p>
<h2>Permanent HEPA filter with suction</h2>
<p>The best thing about the filter and this product is that you just don&#8217;t have to buy and change the filter inside all the time. This is the biggest problem other purifiers have, you have to change their filters every month to get clean air, and of course these replaceable filters are very expensive. But this is not true with this product, it is easy to vacuum it every 3-6 weeks and it will be like new. After vacuuming, the filter will probably be fully cleaned and you can start using the cleaner without having to spend money on expensive replaceable filters. This filter does not need to be replaced if you clean it regularly.</p>
<p>The HEPA filter for this pet air purifier uses technology that means that the consumer will never have the extra cost to buy a replacement. Regular vacuuming is sufficient to keep the vacuum cleaner in good condition.</p>
<p>This air purifier is ideal for any room where your pet spends time and by using 3 speeds, it will handle most odors and rust.</p>

<h2>It&#8217;s worth it.</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hamilton Beach TrueAir&#8217;s $80 fixed price is the best of its kind for a compact cleaner. If you take into account your own operating costs, it becomes more expensive than many of the most efficient models in the entire range. Now buying a full-size model could have a much better value. If you prefer a compact model, the GermGuardian AC4100 is much cheaper.</p>
<p>The HEPA filter is considered to be one of the best purifying air filters, capable of capturing 99% of the parasites and particles floating in the air with a size of 3 microns. With this filter, your own ambient air is purified very quickly. In addition, unlike other cleaners, this filter can capture microparticles of animal skin scales, mould spores and, above all, pollen.</p>
<p>The manufacturer says that you don&#8217;t need to change a filter, but that you should clean it every 3-6 months. Because there is no pre-filter, a filter can be very dirty very quickly. To make cleaning easier, I suggest you clean it regularly. Opening the front panel is very easy by simply pressing the button.</p>
<h2>Powerful performance</h2>
<p>A very important thing with the cleaners you need to look outside of Pour is their power. There are different types of air purifiers, but none of them is as effective as Hamilton Beach. This product can cover moderate spaces of approximately 160 square metres. Fantastic for bedrooms or living rooms.</p>
<h2>Our opinion</h2>
<p>In our compact conflict cleaners, the Hamilton Beach TrueAir was in the back of the backpack, hampered by poor air cleaning performance, fragile controls and expensive filters. If you are looking for a compact cleaner for a small space, we recommend the GermGuardian AC4100. It is more effective in cleaning the air and is cheaper in the long run.</p>
<p>You get what you pay for: a pretty good air purifier, nothing more and nothing less. You don&#8217;t get real HEPA filtration or odour removal. However, you get a fairly powerful dust removal, cleaner air and less sniffing and sneezing.</p>
<p>The Hamilton Beach TrueAir Compact Pet Air Purifier is cheap, but very limited. The device is sufficient to reduce light allergens and pet-related odours and is intended for use in small bedrooms only.</p>
<p>The Hamilton Beach TrueAir Compact Pet Air Purifier is cheap, but very limited. The device is sufficient to reduce light allergens and light odours associated with pets and is intended for use in small bedrooms only. True Air weakens when it comes to much more critical purification responsibilities; this device is not designed to treat strong odors or allergens, and is ineffective in moderate to massive spaces.</p>
<p>Hamilton Beach TrueAir 04384 air purifier is ideal for a person without pets who only needs a small purifying blanket. It can be placed next to a bed or in an office and can filter common contaminants, mainly dust, with minimal maintenance. If you don&#8217;t meet the compromise of airflow at a very affordable price, this simple air purifier can be the ideal alternative for you.</p>
<p>The Hamilton Beach Beach Beach TrueAir Compact Pet air purifier is a large Little model that is able to keep pet smells and fleas at bay. Although it is not designed to help people with seasonal allergies, it seems that it will be useful for some of them.</p>
<p>Since the HEPA filter never needs to be replaced and will remove up to 99% of the contaminants in an area of 140 square meters, the price of less than $50 is worth it.</p>
<p>Hamilton Beach 04383A is a trendy, compact and cheap good air purifier for small spaces. And it really works, but not for everyone. Before purchasing this device, be sure to know which function you need it for.</p>
<p>True Air weakens when it comes to more serious purification responsibilities; this device is not designed to treat strong odors or allergens and is not effective in moderate to massive spaces.</p>
<h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>
<h3>What&#8217;s intriguing about the Hamilton Beach TrueAir air purifier?</h3>
<p>The first thing I noticed when I examined this small number were the dimensions (so small) and the requirements for replacing the filters (not a single one). Promotional photos of the air purifier show that it stands comfortably on a small shelf and doesn&#8217;t look bigger than a small stereo system.</p>
<p>The next thing that made me scratch and frown on my head is the HEPA filter. As a consumer, take note of everything that is advised to you, contrary to the truth, so let us clarify this point. Yes, the filter is of HEPA quality, but this is not true HEPA. A true HEPA filter captures particles up to 0.3 microns, but the filter in this model captures particles up to 3 microns. This usually means that the filter is designed with a HEPA dust and construction, but that the filter does not work at exactly the same level as the actual filter.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not saying Hamilton Beach is meant to deceive you or to allude to you. But many companies use the &#8220;HEPA business card&#8221; to offer the concept that their product contains a real HEPA filter. When you read the specifications to get a quick purchase, it is very easy to think &#8220;big, HEPA filtration&#8221; if this is not quite the situation.</p>
<h3>Does it reduce dust and remove odors from pets or diapers?</h3>
<p>Due to the many reactions of customers to Amazon to get an overview of the adventures of others, some clear trends appear.</p>
<p>Yes, for most people this air purifier will not remove much dust from the air. A large number of studies show that the air is considerably cleaner and consumes much less dust. Many critics have guessed it based on the simple fact that they breathe easier and snort less.</p>
<p>But, he&#8217;s not doing well in capturing the pet&#8217;s floating hair. It is not a good sign if you have very fine cats and dogs that leave little clouds of down behind because they wander through the house.</p>
<p>This air purifier does not necessarily claim to capture particles as large as a pet&#8217;s hair, but it is something that many pet owners expect and seek. I advised you to look further and find an air purifier who likes to slide animal hair into your lungs until it gets into your lungs and gets stuck in your clothes.</p>
<p>What about the smells? It eliminates odors at a moderate level, but not too remarkably. Further on I have a conversation about how many users use a charcoal filter when using this air purifier. This is because it tends to remove odours more effectively than the HEPA quality filter.</p>
<p>The take-away dish? Yeah, it&#8217;ll reduce the dust. He doesn&#8217;t do much work with animal hair. It reduces the odors somewhat, but perhaps not to a high level.</p>
<h3>Does this machine comes with an ionizer?</h3>
<p>No, it doesn&#8217;t have an ionizer, it uses HEPA quality filtration as a crucial purification technology.</p>
<p>If you are placed in an air purifier with an ionizer, reconsider this requirement. Ionizers do not have as much value and are not even as healthy as they are designed to be. Yeah, they hit the air particles and prevent them from &#8220;floating&#8221;. However, these particles eventually remain stuck on the surface of your home. For your healthiest and cleanest air, an air purifier with a genuine HEPA filter is recommended.</p>
<p>Hamilton Beach 04383 will probably not offer you the purest air in the world, but it can do a good to very good job.</p>
<h2>What do customers and critics say?</h2>
<p>Oh yes, the labyrinth of emotion and exclamation marks This is the segment of customer reviews on Amazon. It&#8217;s an extreme place, but very bright. Comments with this air purifier are really a mixed bag &#8211; lots of bright, and also a bit completely dull. To put this into perspective, 13% of the exams fall into the 1-star and 2-star categories, and 79% of these exams fall into the 4-star and 5-star categories.</p>
<p>Here are some of the most common pros and cons of Joyful and n0t-so-happy customers:</p>
<h3>Favorable:</h3>
<p>The silence of this Hamilton Beach allergen Reducing Air Cleaner has been praised many times by favorable critics. The very first speed setting (clean whisper) is what most men and women use 24 hours a day, 7 days a week as standard mode. The moderate and fast cleaning modes are a bit noisier. All you have to do is use them for air purification, so the slightly louder sound isn&#8217;t a problem.</p>
<p>This step is a little controversial. Many tests have shown that they have fully noticed an improvement in allergy symptoms (i.e. they no longer wake up with a blocked and sniffed nose). They have noticed that the dust in their home has clearly decreased and feel that the air is cleaner and fresher.</p>
<p>The reason I&#8217;m saying it&#8217;s controversial is that a small percentage of the tests have reported the opposite&#8230;. Well&#8230; the opposite. We will discuss this again in the &#8220;negative&#8221; section. I think that this is a good indication that the vast majority of people are satisfied with the dust purification techniques. Perhaps even enough to ignore the negative comments in this region.</p>
<p>The price is a &#8220;pro&#8221; favourite because it is very low compared to some additional, more advanced air purifiers that offer the same properties. It&#8217;s pretty cheap for people with smaller budgets who can&#8217;t afford a real HEPA option. In case you have a dusty office or need to maintain a specific space in your slightly cleaner house, it is quite cheap to pick up without a large budget.</p>
<p>Ease of use and compact dimensions are a recurring theme in the Favourable reviews segment. It&#8217;s easy because you have nothing else to do but to run it at the speed you want and leave it. Give the filter a vacuum cleaner when it&#8217;s needed and that&#8217;s essentially the level of maintenance. The compact size has made some people skeptical because they wonder how powerful it really is. On the other hand, the small size is very positive for many people, because it doesn&#8217;t swell the room and doesn&#8217;t take up the space.</p>
<p>Benefits at a glance: quiet, vacuum, affordable, easy to clean, compact, compact</p>
<h3>Negative:</h3>
<p>The 1 and 2 star segment contains a number of comments about &#8220;economic construction&#8221; and &#8220;bad design&#8221; (their words, not ours). Most of these comments are motivated by the combustion of the air purifier after about a month of use or after a broken month. Some users have noticed a rattling sound, but this seems rare, given the many comments that praise tranquillity.</p>
<p>Some people are impressed by the reduction of odors in their home. However, many also said that the odour change is simply not good enough. This model is not defined as an air purifier that eliminates odours, so it is fair that as a specific odour model it cannot provide this service satisfactorily.</p>
<p>If you want to get your air out of the animal&#8217;s drifting hairs, you can choose another model. Customers with pets have noticed that this air purifier is not good for capturing hair from pets. Here&#8217;s my position on this subject: use your vacuum cleaner using pet hair accessories to keep the hair off your floor. This reduces the need for the air purifier to catch the down.</p>
<p>Another powerful &#8220;scam&#8221; in the poor part of these exams seems to be the setting of the highest speed too high. This is only a problem if you need to use this setting when you are in the room at exactly the same time. Otherwise just use the lowest setting and you won&#8217;t notice a thing.</p>
<p>Opposite sketch: cheap construction, does not stink economically, does not catch animal hair, the next speed is for some too high, does not catch enough dust for a number of tastes.</p>

The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) have found that people who are sensitive to mold may have upper respiratory tract symptoms, increased asthma symptoms and skin discomfort when exposed to mold and spores. The World Health Organization (WHO) has studied several studies that have also shown that the existence of mold is correlated with exacerbated respiratory symptoms and asthma symptoms.</p>
<p>In case you have ever needed to treat with mold in almost any capacity, you understand exactly how great a pain in the neck it can be. But what you may not understand is how harmful mold can be if it is a constant material. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, exposure to mold can lead to symptoms such as itching or redness of the eyes or skin, nasal congestion and wheezing.

However, with such a variety of air purifiers on the market today, it is often very difficult to choose the one that best solves your mold problem.

We took the opportunity to give tens of thousands of comments so that we can find the <strong>top rated air purifiers on the market</strong>, which makes it much easier to find the ideal one for your needs.</p>
<h2>What is the difference between a mold air purifier and a dehumidifier?</h2>
<p>A dehumidifier removes moisture from the air. If you&#8217;ve ever lived in a cold, damp house, you&#8217;ll understand the feeling of cold air humidity that you can practically feel your hands wet when you let them pass through the air. A dehumidifier removes and retains moisture. This helps to kill and reduce the total amount of mold in the room, since mold appreciates moisture.</p>
<p>An air purifier does not treat humidity. On the contrary, it brings air to the filter, eliminates airborne spores and releases clean, clean air. A dehumidifier has a bucket that collects moisture (it can be alarming to see exactly how far away).</p>
<p>The two can go hand in hand, but do not do exactly the same job or send out exactly the same results.</p>
<h2>What kind of mold do you have in your house?</h2>
<p>There are more than 400,000 species of mold on Earth. Fortunately, only a thousand of them can live in a household. All these species are divided into three classes.</p>
<p>Allergens. All of these are only dangerous if you have allergies or respiratory problems, such as asthma. Young children are particularly vulnerable to airborne spores.</p>
<p>Pathogen. These are dangerous species that can cause infections. They don&#8217;t affect 100% healthy people, but when your immune system is affected, they can cause severe lung disease.</p>
<p>Toxic. This is really the most dangerous group that contains the famous black mold. This group can affect anyone. They suppress the immune system and can cause cancer. All these species create mycotoxins that are harmful to health when ingested or inhaled. It is possible to get side effects after touching them.</p>
<p>In our homes we are mainly confronted with five types of mold. They are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Alernaria &#8211; occurs on the nose, mouth and upper respiratory tract and can cause allergic reactions.</li>
<li>Aspergillus &#8211; Normally observed in extremely humid environments. It settles in house dust and can produce mycotoxins, which cause many lung diseases.</li>
<li>Cladosporium &#8211; This is a quick and easy way to remove fabrics, wood and other porous surfaces. It can cause hay fever and asthma.</li>
<li>Penicillium &#8212; likes to grow on the bottom, carpet and fiberglass insulation. It can cause asthma and allergies. Can produce mycotoxins.</li>
<li>Stachybotrys &#8211; Toxic form or black form that leads to mycotoxin and causes serious problems, such as lung bleeding. It is not as common in households as in the other four types of households. It can be applied on paper or wood, but perhaps not on tiles or concrete.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Essential functions to search for on a mold air purifier</h2>
<p>Now, you know the severity of the mold problem, you may wonder how to find the best home air purifier to deal with this important business?</p>
<p>When you&#8217;re looking for an air purifier to remove mold, you&#8217;ll find three important features to remember. Buying a unit that offers all the options listed below will help you ensure that your home remains free from harmful mold spores.</p>
<ol>
<li>True HEPA Filter</li>
</ol>
<p>The very first thing you want to make sure that the ambient air purifier has a True HEPA filter. This filter is vital because it can capture particles up to 0.3 microns. Includes all types of mold spores that can be found in your home. A device that has no real HEPA postage costs does not give you any assurance that it will help solve this problem. Avoid air cleaners that indicate &#8220;HEPA-like&#8221; or even &#8220;HEPA-like&#8221; or even &#8220;HEPA-type&#8221; because they are bad on some True HEPA devices.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Ultra Violet Light</li>
</ol>
<p>Ultra Violet (UV) light can also be crucial because it kills mold spores. It works by using a beam of light to purify the spores and ruin their DNA makeup. UV light is contained in the air purifier without releasing light into the room. It&#8217;s an excellent backup system for your own True HEPA filter because it kills contaminants it can&#8217;t catch.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Active Carbon Filter</li>
</ol>
<p>This filter can also be a must as it detects mold smells where the other two types are spreading &#8211; it removes mold smells. Activated carbon is excellent for absorbing toxic volatile organic compounds and microbial volatile organic compounds that cause mold. With this property, the mold odour will continue to exist.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Cleaning quantities or speeds</li>
</ol>
<p>Iit is useful to have different ventilation speeds, as this allows you to control the speed at which the air has circulated. During the wet and cold months when the fungus comes out, it is possible to increase the fan speed as much as possible to obtain a complete cleaning. Then, during the warmer seasons, once you&#8217;ve figured out how to ventilate your home (i.e. available windows and sunlight), you can slow down the speed. Some air purifiers have an intelligent detector that evaluates the quality of the air and also adjusts the speed of the fan to the level of air pollution. (Levoit are great for offering such features).</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>The space it could cover</li>
</ol>
<p>Air purifiers are designed to meet the specific dimensions of the space. For example, one model can handle the air in a 400 square meter space, while the other model can handle an area of 1000 square feet (instead of another space&#8230; but we won&#8217;t dwell on it). As long as the specifications clearly indicate the square meters, everything will be fine). Evaluate for which space you want your air purifier. Could it be a small room? A big garage? A medium-sized living room or a large open-plan office? Make sure your air purifier matches the invoice.</p>
<p>Buying an air purifier that has a combination of these three features is the golden ticket to a mold free and odorless home.</p>
<p>Below you will find the two best products that meet these criteria and that are still at the top of the mold removal list.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The Best <strong>Air Purifiers For Mold</strong> &#8211; Top-Picks</h2>
<p>An <strong>air purifier for mold</strong> in your own home and breathing in clean, fresh air is essential. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s essential to keep reading and looking at the reviews of the 6 best products available in the industry today. They are not presented in a specific order, just select the order that suits you best.</p>
<h3>ALEN BREATHESMART CLASSIC LARGE ROOM AIR PURIFIER</h3>
<p>With the BreatheSmart air purifier from Alen, an area of 1100 m2&#8230;. Ft. is cleaned every 30 minutes. It was designed and built by NASA engineers using WhisperMax technology. In turbo mode, it therefore operates twice as quietly as most other products. This device is ideal for people with allergies. Thanks to this HEPA silver filter, generated with an antimicrobial compound, the growth of bacteria and mold is prevented.</p>
<p>This air purifier is known as air-smart because of the properties of Laser Smart technology. This innovative technology allows you to detect airborne particles up to 0.3 microns, and with this air quality indicator light you can always know the state of the air quality around you.</p>
<p>This device comes with a lifetime warranty. You don&#8217;t have to worry if this air purifier fits in your home, because the Alen BreatheSmart air purifier comes with 14 separate panels.</p>
<p>The pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>Silent operation and contains 4 alternatives to fan speed</li>
<li>Operates in automatic mode, where the fan speed is automatically adjusted.</li>
<li>Lifetime warranty</li>
<li>This air purifier absorbs smoke, cooking smells and pet smells with 1.5 lbs. of activated carbon.</li>

</ul>
<h3>GermGuardian 3-in-1 True Hepa Air Purifier (AC4825)</h3>
<p>This slim model features genuine HEPA filtration to remove mold spores, as well as a carbon filter to neutralise sharp smells. In addition, the UV-C light that zaps into the air has germs such as viruses (hence the name germs). However, I note that UV-C lamps are polarised and controversial because of the ozone problem.</p>
<p>Manufacturers have promised that their UV-C lamps will not produce ozone, but they do not have a shut-off switch in the event of a problem. It really is an excellent alternative to small apartments or special rooms because it is small enough to integrate discreetly. Moreover, it is cheap enough for you to buy more than you can put on your house, one in the basement and one in the bedroom.</p>
<p>This specific unit has UV-C technology that works to purify the air better than many of the air purifiers available on the market.</p>
<p>It is able to reduce the amount of germs, viruses, germs and even mold spores in the air.</p>
<p>This device also contains a HEPA filter that can hold 99.97% of the contaminants and dust from plant pollen, animal skins and much more.</p>
<p>This alone makes it worthwhile as some of these additional air filters available on the market require a much more frequent filter change.</p>
<p>The device has a flexible 3-speed adjustment that makes it powerful enough to filter medium sized parts.</p>
<p>It is easily one of the best air purification options on the market with possibilities that exceed the price point.</p>
<p>Main features :</p>
<ul>
<li>Genuine HEPA filtration</li>
<li>Carbon filter for smells</li>
<li>UV-C light to kill germs and pathogens (ideal for mold spores)</li>
<li>Great price (it changes, but usually below 150 dollars and often below 100 dollars).</li>
<li>Different speed quantities</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, it contains three different speed settings, allowing changes and choices to be made according to current conditions.</p>
<p>The filter is designed to last approximately six months until it needs to be replaced. Here, too, it may be necessary to replace it earlier or slightly longer, depending on the ecological conditions.</p>

<p>It has a modern appearance and steps of less than 10 x 10 x 15 inches and weighs over 7 pounds. It can even fit on a small table. In addition, it comes with a 2-year warranty.</p>

<h2>What needs to be done to remove mold?</h2>
<p>Mold particles are small enough to pass through the eyelashes of your sinuses and also small enough to be easily exhaled so that they can nestle in your lung tissue. Larger particles, such as dust, are often captured by the eyelashes until they penetrate the lungs.</p>
<h3>Exposure to mold can be dangerous</h3>
<p>Some mold, known as mycotoxins, are products of the mold metabolism and can be toxic. Allergic reactions to fungus are usually runny nose, sneezing, red eyes, rash and symptoms usually associated with colds or hay fever. Symptoms often appear immediately, but can sometimes be delayed by hours. People with asthma can also have allergic reactions to mold. Infants, children and the elderly can suffer a lot from mold inhalation compared to healthy adults.</p>
<h3>The mold spores are microscopic</h3>
<p>Most mold spores are between 3 and 100 microns in size, but some can be as small as 1 microns. If you look at air purifiers that remove mold, it is very important to invest in a treatment that removes at least 3 microns of particles of a smaller size. HEPA air purifiers are really an excellent method to remove mold spores from the indoor air. In fact, our product experts specifically recommend HEPA air purifiers with this particular problem, and it is one of the best air purification technologies available to combat fungus, at AirPurifiers.com.</p>
<h3>Mold can be difficult to remove</h3>
<p>Even if you can&#8217;t completely get rid of mold in your home, it can be significantly reduced. If your house is old, the risk of mold problems is greater. Newer, watertight houses that do not allow sufficient air circulation can also be problematic. Office buildings can also often be contaminated with mold.</p>
<h3>The removal of mold can be a constant process</h3>
<p>Small visible areas of the fungus should be cleaned with household purifiers and also with dried areas. On the other hand, mold is often not visible because it is found in hidden places. Mold may be on a surface, but when the surface is interrupted, the spores spread through the air and begin to cause problems for individuals. Normally the spores settle over time, but when disturbed, they are absorbed in the airstream. This is where continuous operation or air purifiers form mold or can be of great help to get a clean interior.</p>
<h3>Aeramax 300 Large Room Air Purifier</h3>
<p>The AeraMax 300 air purifier is suitable for large spaces. Roofs from 300 to 600 m². It is asthma and allergy characterized by the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America. Thanks to this True HEPA filter, 99.9% of these airborne particles, such as house dust mites, mold spores, cigarette smoke and other household pollen smells, are recorded.</p>
<p>With this filter change indicator you can always know when it is time to change these two filters, a red light will appear on the LED display. You can set the milling speed manually, or with this AeraSmart Sensor the AeraMax 300 air purifier will automatically correct the fan speed.</p>
<p>The AeraMax 300 purifier contains 4 stages of purification for maximum protection against germs and allergies indoors. It is efficient and very quiet.</p>
<p>The pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>Including automatic sense recognition technology for optimum air purification.</li>
<li>It is certified by AFOA.</li>
<li>Thanks to this charcoal filter, all household smells, cigarette smoke and pet smells are recorded.</li>
</ul>
<p>Against:</p>
<ul>
<li>The blue light is very bright and it is better not to place this air purifier in the room.</li>
<li>The ionizer makes a loud noise, and you should turn it off every time you turn on the air purifier.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Winix 5300-2 Air Purifier with True HEPA Filter</h3>
<p>This is a very popular model that uses angular construction and real HEPA filtration. In addition, it contains &#8220;PlasmaWave&#8221;, an ozone free permanent filter designed to neutralize odors, germs and pollutants in the air. It&#8217;s ideal for your office because it&#8217;s an odour-neutralising carbon filter next to a HEPA and PlasmaWave filter.</p>
<p>The air quality in the offices can vary depending on the year, the number of men and women working at the same time and the cleanliness of the space. The Smart Sensor is a great feature because it automatically evaluates the air and adjusts the fan speed accordingly. During the more muscular weeks when mold grows (i.e. in the winter when condensation occurs), the Winix 5300-2 can increase the fan speed without you having to keep an eye on it.</p>
<p>Main features :</p>
<ul>
<li>Genuine HEPA filtration</li>
<li>Permanent PlasmaWave filter</li>
<li>Carbon filter for smells</li>
<li>4 ventilation speeds such as &#8220;turbo&#8221; for cases where the air is particularly stale or dusty</li>
<li>Smart sensors test the air to see which fan speed is needed.</li>
<li>Ideal for medium sized rooms, offices and reception areas</li>
</ul>
<h3>AllerAir AirMedic Pro 5 MG</h3>
<p>This is a pretty expensive model (about $700), but in an inhabited office it&#8217;s worth it. It occupies a lot of space (about 1500 square meters) making it ideal for open plan offices. The filters are of superior quality and are therefore designed to purify the air from allergens, chemicals and smells, including smells and mold-related particles.</p>
<p>Main features :</p>
<ul>
<li>Genuine medical HEPA filter of medical quality</li>
<li>Active carbon filter for mold smells</li>
<li>Has wheels for easy mobility in the office in different regions</li>
<li>3 ventilation speeds for airflow control</li>

In fact, this purifier can remove up to 99.97% of airborne particles larger than 0.3 microns. This high percentage, together with the amount of filters that can make the mold marks work, will provide you with an excellent opportunity to get rid of them as quickly as possible. This device can also be used at different levels of speed, so you can adapt it to your needs. What is impressive, however, is the simple fact that this unit, even at the highest speed, can be silent. The only problem with this purifier is that it is a relatively short range, although it will also help you to keep the big effects focused in terms of mold care.

Provided you have a real HEPA filter (or at least one HEPA filter), an active carbon filter and an alternative fan speed, you&#8217;re on the right track.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re wondering which model to choose, I&#8217;d say the PureZone 3-in-1 True HEPA air purifier is your best choice.

This may be for smaller rooms, but it&#8217;s so affordable that you can take 2 and put one in the bedroom and one in the living room when you&#8217;re ready.</p>
<h2>Prevention Of Mold And Mildew</h2>
<p>Killing mold with your air purifier is a good prevention. To increase the effectiveness of mold and mildew prevention, you can count on the following activities.</p>
<p>Repair of leaks: Leaking pipes or roof systems can increase the humidity in your home and create an ideal environment for mold formation. Repair dry areas and clear wet areas immediately.</p>
<p>Cleaning after the flood: Don&#8217;t just leave your cellar under water, as it&#8217;s a huge source of moisture for mold growth. Post-flood cleaning is essential to keep your cellar dry.</p>
<p>Check the air outlet: The kitchen and bathroom are the most likely places for mold growth. Make sure that the air vent works as well as possible to remove moisture from the outside of the house.</p>
<p>And last but not least, you should pick up your best <strong>mold air purifier</strong> in 2019. Thanks for reading!</p>

The Levoit LV-H132 works as an aerodynamic system that allows users to purify the air in small spaces such as the bedroom or the office.</p>
<p>The LV-H132 probably doesn&#8217;t look strange on a desk or in a high-quality bathroom, because it has a soft and attractive blue light. And that&#8217;s good news, because it&#8217;s perfect for small spaces. Levoit recommends that you simply place the cleaner in a place that is less than 90 square meters for best results.</p>
<p>We also appreciate that the air purifier is equipped with a three-phase cleaning system and some intelligent features of the more expensive cleaners.</p>
<p>This air purifier is the best solution for a consumer who wants to remove smoke, dust, skin flakes, skin flakes, pollen and mould spores from his home environment.</p>
<p>An air purifier would be your answer if you are tired of allergies that attack from time to time, acquiring a dry throat when you wake up, and in case you are not able to afford the prices of other air purifiers.</p>

<h2>What is fascinating about Levoit LV-H132?</h2>
<p>At first glance, this can be an attractive air purifier. If you want a brand new, white and curved look, you might prefer the look of the model. But it is only the tip of the iceberg that makes the Levoit LV-H132 so fascinating.</p>
<p>A small intriguing detail is that the pilot light, a blue light that divides the top of the machine. I discovered this fascinatingly because I imagined, &#8220;Who needs this?&#8221; Looking back, it can be very useful for brown spots on the way to the bathroom at night. It can also be ideal for children who are not prepared for the full shade of sleep and for parents who are not afraid of the famous blue light.</p>
<p>Now, in order to obtain a more substantial quality of interest, the 3-step filter system. The primary filter is a pre-filter and the second is a real HEPA (yes, it captures particles of only 0.3 microns). The next one is the activated carbon filter for the pickaxe to reduce odours. In theory, this should include the most &#8220;small pieces&#8221; of air, from the smallest to the largest to the most fragrant. Later we&#8217;ll see if we can do it or not.</p>
<p>The unique size of the LV-H132 makes it an ideal addition to almost any room. Cylindrical in shape, it is 14.5 inches high and has a diameter of 8.5 inches. It only weighs 6.6 pounds.</p>
<p>Its compactness makes it discreet, but like its counterpart, the LV-PUR131, it requires about 14 centimetres of free space in walls, walls or other elements that can affect its accessibility in the air circulation of a room.</p>
<p>Installation is also easy. Dispose of the device out of its plastic packaging. A quick turn at the base of this unit removes the bottom plate and gives you access to this filter. Remove the plastic cover from the filter, replace it (again, tabs are provided to indicate that the filter surface should be outward facing) and reattach the base. Just plug it in and you&#8217;re ready to go. In addition to a complete manual, clearly published and comprehensible installation instructions are provided.</p>
<p>The LV-H132 contains three modes:</p>
<ul>
<li>One for the night</li>
<li>One for continuous use throughout the day</li>
<li>And also the highest setting for use in extreme conditions.</li>
</ul>
<p>It will effectively remove 99.97% of the impurities from the air up to a size of 0.3 microns. This includes allergens, smoke, dust, fungi and odors from home and pets. Each setting is achieved by simply pressing the correct sensor with your finger.</p>
<p>The LV-H132 also comes with a pilot light on top of the unit. One button switches the light on again to dim the light and the other button switches it off.</p>
<p>Although night lighting is an intelligent key and can be very useful, it is also a little too bright, even in the darkest of settings. The light is really bright and cold blue; a softer and warmer light is suitable for a dark room. However, for people who do not obey the light, it is a pleasant quality.</p>
<p>In all the sets we used in our <strong>review of Levoit LV-H132</strong>, it was perfectly executed, especially in the artist&#8217;s studio where the smell of paint was spread.</p>
<p>In most situations, it eliminates odours and leaves the air clear and clean. From the bedroom to the lowest position, there was a quiet white sound that was conducive to sleep; even in the higher positions, the sound was not enough to interrupt sleep.</p>
<p>For daylight use, we left the device in the middle position. This has really helped to reduce dust and pet allergens from the bedroom, as at night breathing becomes easier with much less sine congestion and lung irritation.</p>
<h2>Characteristics of Levoit LV-H132</h2>
<p>Characteristic for this Levoit H132 is a basic air purification with the help of a simple and pleasant aesthetics.</p>
<h3>3-step filtration</h3>
<p>The <strong>Levoit LV-H132 air purifier</strong> contains a three-stage filtration system, which will help remove a wide range of particles and cure various problems such as unpleasant odours, smoke or pet odours.</p>
<h3>FILTRATION SYSTEM</h3>
<p>Given the dimensions of the air purifier, the amount of filtration phases is striking.</p>
<ol>
<li>Fine Pre-Filter &#8212; This filter covers all large particles flying in the air. Although the TrueHEPA filter can also treat them, large contaminants shorten the life of the filter. That&#8217;s why a pre-filter saves money. It protects airborne pathogens, large fungal spores, animal hair, etc. The pre-filter is not washable and therefore does not try to do this. You may damage the other filters. Change the pre-filter and the different filters every 6 to 9 weeks.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>TrueHEPA Filter &#8211; This filter treats 99.97% of particles with a diameter of 0.3 microns. This means that it protects the allergens, pollen and animal skin scales that make your life miserable. Air purifiers equipped with trueHEPA filters are an excellent choice for all environments. This filter should be replaced approximately every 6 to 9 weeks.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Active carbon filter &#8212; This filter creates odours. Therefore, if you have a smoker in your home, prefer to cook dishes with exotic smells, such as large pets or other fragrances to take care of, this charcoal filter can treat them quickly. The filter should be changed every 6 to 9 weeks, depending on how often the device is used.</li>
</ol>

<h3>3 Speed settings.</h3>
<p>The air purifier comes with three speed settings, depending on what you hope to achieve with the performance.</p>
<h3>Night light.</h3>
<p>The device is equipped with two separate night-light settings, which means you don&#8217;t have to worry about waking up too bright when you have to sleep during surgery, which will help you with your allergies.</p>
<h3>Quiet operation.</h3>
<p>With its almost silent operation, this air purifier will certainly keep you awake at night.</p>
<h3>No harmful side effects.</h3>
<p>Since this cleaner does not use ions or UV radiation, it is safe to use, even if you have respiratory problems. By not emitting any harmful substances, you can keep the device running for longer without having to worry.</p>
<h2>How Does it Look &amp; Feel?</h2>
<p>The Levoit air purifier is made in a small setup so that it can affect the environment as quickly as possible. The power of the product can be attributed to HEPA technology, which filters 99.97% of the impurities in the air you want to get rid of. This technology makes it possible to filter particles as small as 0.3 microns and improve overall health by purifying the PM 2.5 contamination. In this way it creates the best environment for pet owners, children and the elderly.</p>
<p>For people suffering from allergies and sinus congestion, this air purifier is ideal because the air passes through three filtration phases: HEPA, active carbon filters, but also good preliminary rounds. All these elements work together to reduce smoking, kitchen odor in your living room and pet odor.</p>
<p>The small machine occupies a living room of about 30 square meters. The control panel is easy to use and transparent to navigate; the automatic button automatically monitors the air quality in the room. The speed can be controlled by setting it at a low, medium or high filtration speed.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25" src="https://a1linksnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/levoit-lv-h132-room-size.jpg" alt="levoit lv-h132 room size" width="750" height="408" srcset="https://a1linksnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/levoit-lv-h132-room-size.jpg 750w, https://a1linksnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/levoit-lv-h132-room-size-300x163.jpg 300w, https://a1linksnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/levoit-lv-h132-room-size-360x196.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<h2>Does it reduce dust and remove tobacco, pet or diaper odour?</h2>
<p>Removing dust is one thing that this filter seems to work well. That&#8217;s what it should do, since there will be three filters at the end. The pre-filter and the actual HEPA filter absorb contaminants of different sizes for maximum air purification capacity. On the official website of Levoit it says that the pre-filter &#8220;helps to apply bacteria, animal skin flakes, fungi and parasites in the air&#8221;. HEPA then collects &#8220;house dust mites, coarse particles and pollen&#8221;.</p>
<p>But do not choose the duration of the company, of course they will sing his praise. Critics are in favour of the dedusting section. Many people have noticed that the dust in their homes clearly decreases and can literally see how the dust accumulates around the machine.</p>
<p>Now, your smells. The 3-stage filter contains an active carbon filter that is particularly suitable for the removal of odours in rooms. Levoit&#8217;s website states that &#8220;cooking aromas, pet fragrances and cigarette smoke&#8221; are one of the crucial scents it targets. That sounds good, because the thick kitchen smells and annoying pets don&#8217;t make a new home. The owners of the model agree, and many of them were happy with the decrease in the number of air fresheners.</p>
<p>Despite its small size, the Levoit compensates for all defects by being very easy to use. Turn it around, press the on/off button and you&#8217;ll purify the air. You want to make it even quieter or make the fan even slower&#8230;. Simply press the fan button several times at one speed. If you only need a small amount of light, it is possible to switch from no light, in low light, to a fairly bright blue light by simply pressing the button on the lamp. When the filter needs maintenance, simply replace it and press the button that looks a bit like a sheet of newspaper. It&#8217;s about as simple as that&#8230; we&#8217;re not sure why they even include a manual.</p>
<h2>Similarities Between the LV-PUR131 and LV-H132 Air Purifiers</h2>
<p>The two units:</p>
<ul>
<li>Operation with a real HEPA filter</li>
<li>Filter particles from 0.3 microns and larger, and filter the air pollution of PM 2.5.</li>
<li>Have three filtration stages: Preparatory, real HEPA and activated carbon.</li>
<li>Change the filter every 6 weeks or so</li>
<li>Why are 100% ozone free, do not use UV rays or impurities that produce minute amounts of measurable ozone.</li>
<li>Provide a 2-year warranty and lifetime support</li>
<li>A color-coded light that indicates the quality of the air in the room.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Levoit Air Purifier Maintenance</h2>
<p>Maintenance for this purpose is not a massive task for the Levoit LV-H132, but there are costs involved.</p>
<p>This air purifier has three filters, but when it&#8217;s time to replace them, they&#8217;re really sold in pairs, so you don&#8217;t have to worry about replacing the filters separately.</p>
<p>Levoit says the filters are designed to last about 6 weeks. In case you need to use this air purifier 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, it can cost about $30-40 per year. It is possible to find the Levoit H132 replacement filters.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-23 size-full" src="https://a1linksnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/levoit-lv-h132-manual.jpg" alt="levoit lv-h132 manual" width="750" height="414" srcset="https://a1linksnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/levoit-lv-h132-manual.jpg 750w, https://a1linksnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/levoit-lv-h132-manual-300x166.jpg 300w, https://a1linksnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/levoit-lv-h132-manual-360x199.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<h2>What is the sound level of your Levoit LV-H132?</h2>
<p>The Levoit LV-H132 has three separate fan speed settings, with each setting producing a small variation in the amount of noise.</p>
<p>In the lower fan mode, the Levoit air purifier is currently about 40 dB and at the highest fan speed, the decibel level is closer to 53 dB (according to our tests at home).</p>
<h2>Who should buy the Levoit LV-H132 purifier?</h2>
<p>The Levoit LV-H132 certainly has its advantages and disadvantages, but in general it is a good choice.</p>
<p>The Levoit LV-H132 is the best for those who&#8230;:</p>
<ol>
<li>Have a small space: The LV-H132 is simply designed to handle spaces of about 86 square meters when you have a small distance, it works very well, but we do not recommend it for spaces that are much larger than that. If you have a larger space, consider the Levoit LV-PUR131 or even see additional air purifiers that we have tested here.</li>
<li>I want to get value for money: If you&#8217;re looking for something that has a lower price, but does the job well and looks good, then the Levoit LV H-132 can certainly be a good alternative.</li>
<li>You want an easy-to-use air purifier: the fundamental design of this Levoit makes it incredibly easy to understand and use. The tactile control is intuitive and the lack of bells and whistles makes it very easy to understand how to operate it. Just plug it in, choose a speed and it&#8217;s over.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Does it have an ionizer?</h2>
<p>No ionizer to see here is good news. It&#8217;s been proven that ionisers produce ozone in your environment&#8230;. which completely removes the need for an air purifier. The aim is to obtain clean and pollution-free air, this is the task of the filters. This air purifier uses 3 filtration steps to purify the air.</p>
<h2>How can you use it?</h2>
<p>Like most air purifiers, Levoit is as easy as a cake.</p>
<p>When you open the box</p>
<ul>
<li>Remove the plastic from the filters and put them back in the unit.</li>
<li>Find a place for your own air purifier with an electric output at your fingertips</li>
<li>Make sure the unit is 15 inches from any object.</li>
<li>Turn on the device and select the desired ventilation mode (1, 2 or 3).</li>
<li>Play with the pilot light and decide if it will bother you or charm you.</li>
</ul>
<p>Keep an eye on the filter&#8217;s reset button. When the light is on, check the filters and replace them if necessary.</p>
<h2>How does it relate to other models?</h2>
<h3>Levels LV-H132 vs. honeywell HPA300</h3>
<p>The most striking difference between these two models on the first Sight is the shape and colour: the Honeywell HPA300 is black and angular, the Levoit is white and curved. They are comparable in terms of style and maintenance when it comes to filtration.</p>
<p>The Honeywell has 2 filters (a real HEPA and a pre-filter), of which one or the other should be replaced instead of washed, exactly enjoying the Levoit. Levoit has a more complete filtration and does much better to reduce dust and allergy symptoms.</p>
<h3>Levoit LV-H132 vs. Germguardian AC4825</h3>
<p>The GermGuardian AC4825 is very similar in price to Levoit, but there are some important differences. Instead of 3 filters there are 2 filters (a HEPA filter plus a carbon filter) plus a UV-C light filter. UV-C light is designed to kill airborne bacteria and germs.</p>
<p>Both models have 3 speeds, adapt to small parts and neutralize odors. GermGuardian is larger in size (especially larger) and contains a similar weight. Levoit is white and GermGuardian is also embarrassing, which may seem like a small difference, but for many, aesthetics is important.</p>
<h3>Levels LV-H132 vs. Winix 5500-2.</h3>
<p>The Winix 5500-2 is a whole new world compared to this Levoit. This does not mean that it is always better, but it will have more possibilities to compensate for the higher price. This sounds in the first place as follows: that the Winix is rectangular, black and quite large. Winix has intelligent fantasy sensors that tell the machine which cleaning mode to use depending on the air conditioning.</p>
<p>The Winix has 4 fan speeds instead of the 3 of these Levoit. 3 Technically, the Winix has 3 levels of filtration, but they disagree. One of these filtration phases is a permanent filter device called &#8220;PlasmaWave Technology&#8221;. It works to break down the smallest amount of contaminants, odors and allergens. The other two filters and all Winix are: an authentic HEPA filter and a carbon filter.</p>
<h3>Levoit LV-H132 vs molekule</h3>
<p>The Molekule essentially blows other air purifiers out of this water, at a price and effect. It&#8217;s not to mention Levoit and it has colleagues who are not worthy, they certainly are not. It is only that the holes are very marked when you look at the Molekule. The exterior is made of a matt and elegant silver alloy, with a peach-coloured conveyor belt.</p>
<p>The Molekule has its patented cleaning technology, PECO, which in addition to filters also uses light technology. In essence, it captures everything, and on a ridiculously small scale. The CCEE is called catching particles 1000 smaller than the people who could catch a HEPA. Don&#8217;t feel bad for your Levoit, it&#8217;s all worth it when you need a good air purifier.</p>
<p>If you want the most advanced, advanced and sophisticated air purifier, then the Molecular Molecule is probably the only one&#8230;. if you have the money.</p>
<h2>Levoit LV-H132 : Conclusion</h2>
<p><strong>The Levoit LV-H132 Air Purifier</strong> has a score of 4.4 out of 5 stars on Amazon, which shows the satisfaction of the majority of consumers. Among the men who rated it as an excellent product, said it was worthwhile because he had used it in his home, where two smokers use it, there was a significant increase in the amount of clean and refreshing air.</p>
<p>The product has also made a difference for people with allergies in the home. Another consumer in Arizona, a region where dust storms are common and where pollen from weeds, trees and grass are abundant, saw a much better environment.</p>
<p>On the back there were many complaints, such as the filter indicator which became conservative after only a few days of use. Another criticism was directed at the purifier, which cleans only a small area as a single component, so that some customers had to buy more than one purifier, but of course the advantages outweigh the disadvantages.</p>
<p>In fact, we believe that it is more than capable of controlling all the smells or eliminating all the allergens that could cause you a problem, because we simply believe that it is really that good.</p>
<p>Why are there better choices? I totally agree. However, expect to pay double or even more for something that looks so good and purifiers better. If you want to compare something more expensive in exactly the same category, check out the Blue Pure 411. It&#8217;s a bit more expensive, but we believe it releases the Levoit in almost all aspects.</p>
<p>The <strong>Levoit LV-H132 is worth of money</strong> to those who</p>
<ul>
<li>You want to reduce food and smoke odors.</li>
<li>Like the concept of a night-light.</li>
<li>Need help with your allergy symptoms</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t worry about a little constant illumination.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t mind the little white noises.</li>
<li>Will be satisfied with accurate HEPA filtration.</li>
<li>Rather a white layout</li>
<li>Need a small price tag</li>
<li>You want to see a reduction in house dust.</li>

With a rating of 4.3 stars and more than six thousand comments, it is fair to say that the AC4825 is one of the best tested air purifiers on the market. This is great for anyone who wants proven quality and durability.</p>

<ul>
<li>We provide honest evaluations (for and against) so that everyone can be sure that they have the best choices.</li>
<li>We do not exaggerate (and never exaggerate) a product to allow you to click on the links and buy this product blindly.</li>
</ul>
<h2 data-fontsize="24" data-lineheight="36">Description of the GermGuardian AC4825</h2>
<p>The GermGuardian AC4825 comes in a beautiful 7×10.2×21.5 inch box. This air purifier is designed to remove allergens from the air it rejects. According to GermGuardian, this air purification system is effective in capturing 99.97% of the air pollutants.</p>
<p>The GermGuardian Cleaner is a three-in-one system that integrates the HEPA filter recommended by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the American Lung Association to capture and remove dust, particles, pollen and odors from the air. One of the interesting features that really make it so effective is the soft UV-C disinfectant that kills bacteria trapped in the air of the filters.</p>
<p>The machine cleans the air in your home and all contaminants in the indoor air, making it allergen free and improving quality. This should be particularly interesting for people with allergies and asthma.</p>
<p>How can such a statement be encouraged? Well, the device overlaps several layers of security:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A true HEPA filter mechanism</strong> that is ideally suited for catching plant plumes, spores, dander and mites, to name but a few.<br />
UV light is acceptable to kill germs and viruses in the air. The AC4825 is equipped with a UV-based mechanism that removes viruses, bacteria and other germs. Thanks to the layers, this unit successfully eliminates rhinoviruses, streptococcus and E. coli to produce the atmosphere in your room without germs. UV-C light destroys these pathogens through an intelligent and energy-saving mechanism.</li>
<li><strong>UV light</strong> is acceptable to kill germs and viruses in the air. The AC4825 is equipped with a UV-based mechanism that kills germs, bacteria and other germs. Due to the special layers, this unit effectively eliminates rhinoviruses, streptococcus and E. coli to produce the atmosphere in your room without germs. UV-C light destroys these pathogens with an intelligent and energy-saving mechanism.</li>
<li><strong>Odour-reducing media</strong>. Pets and regular household activities can be a source of smells. If you do not reduce this terrible smell, the environment around you may become unpleasant. The AC4825 is designed to reduce unpleasant odours in your room and create an original environment. This system uses a carbon filter to remove odors and smoke particles from your room.</li>
</ul>
<h2 data-fontsize="24" data-lineheight="36">Features and specifications of the GermGuardian AC4825</h2>
<p>The AC4825 is the item that has the best value of Guardian air purifiers. The capacity of the unit is exactly the same as that of other units, which cost up to three times as much. The main reason why this device belongs to the top of its class is that it is a quality air purifier that costs less than comparable models. The multiple purification technologies used in this system clean the air of all impurities.</p>

</ul>
<h2 data-fontsize="24" data-lineheight="36">GermGuardian Filter AC4825</h2>
<p>GermGuardian AC4825 Includes a 3 in 1 air purification system with these air filters as below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Pre-filter &#8211; By mixing with the activated carbon filter, this air filter layer can remove most of the large polluting particles and reduce odours created by smoke, cooking and pets.</li>
<li>True HEPA Filter &#8212; GermGuardian AC4825E uses an authentic HEPA filter to capture 99.97% of microscopic allergens, dust and mould spores up to 0.3 microns.</li>
<li>UV-C Light &#8211; With a UV-C lamp, GermGuardian AC4825E can kill bacteria, viruses and fungal spores in the air.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Germ Guardian AC4825 contains an activated carbon pre-filter that is a thin layer of activated carbon. This pre-filter is connected to the HEPA filter. The last two are placed at the front of the UV-C light. The AC4825 air purifier offers three levels of air filtration to ensure that most air pollutants are treated.</p>
<p>The 2 filters are combined into one filter package and are assembled. They are replaced by a year about every 8 weeks and are carried out at exactly the same time. The travel costs are about $30. The HEPA filter segment of the AC4825 is made of a dense and folded fibrous material. Another section, the activated carbon pre-filter/filter, is responsible for capturing larger particles in addition to odours and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the atmosphere. It is effective for an excellent filter capacity and works very well. The filter can capture almost 100% of all particles in its own airflow up to 0.3 microns!</p>
<p>The High Efficiency Particulate Filter (HEPA) is excellent for eliminating the most common air quality problems, especially those that cause allergies. The HEPA filter captures 99.97% of the particles that pass through it up to a size of 0.3 microns.</p>
<p>GermGuardian AC4825 is powered by an identical True HEPA filter from Guardian Technologies, FLT 4825 filter-B HEPA to help capture the smallest contaminating particles as small as 0.3 microns, including dust, dust mite, pollen, animal hair, scales and other allergens. The same version as the larger version &#8211; GermGuardian AC5000, GermGuardian AC4825 also has a pre-filter with a connected activated carbon coating to reduce smoke and odours. In addition to these normal filter layers, GermGuardian AC4825 supports a UV-C lamp to improve the ability to kill fungi and viruses. This means that it is able to capture microscopic elements.</p>
<p>Here’s the basic list of air contaminants the AC4825 can remove:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pet skin flakes</li>
<li>Animal hair (thanks to the pre-filter)</li>
<li>Dust mite allergens</li>
<li>Pollen</li>
<li>Dust and dust</li>
<li>Building particles</li>
<li>Remnants of smoke</li>
<li>Smoke scents</li>
<li>Chemical and natural fragrances</li>
<li>Chemical vapours</li>
</ul>
<h2 data-fontsize="24" data-lineheight="36">Look and feel</h2>
<p>We have to say that we find the design very beautiful, contemporary and serious. So far, I haven&#8217;t come across an air purifier designed like this Germguardian. Of course it has to do what it&#8217;s done for, but in my opinion, design is also important because you don&#8217;t need an air purifier that will spoil your interior design. In addition, the AC4825 has a very useful new feature that many other air purifiers don&#8217;t have, it&#8217;s the filter change indicator light and UV-C spare light if you don&#8217;t have to remember the last time you changed your filter to get the cleaner running at an optimal level.</p>
<p>Note that you can have the white version of the air purifier, under the title GermGuardian AC4825W. Our test version is a black version, but thanks to the Guardian Technologies manual, both air purifiers work to exactly the same specifications. So if you are looking for a GermGuardian AC4825W exam, you can even read our exam now.</p>
<p>The AC4825 is built with a good quality and feel ABS plastic housing and has a low gloss black finish. The top is finished in matt silver with a satin black shirt section around the controllers.</p>
<p>One of the first things you see when you have GermGuardian AC4825 in your home is that, despite its 22-inch height, the design of the air purifier is completely the same as its older brother, GermGuardian AC5000.</p>
<p>Follow this layout language, this 22-inch air purifier is prepared with a front air outlet and a suction grille from the trunk. This timeless airflow is the exceptional quality of the GermGuardian air purifier, to increase the efficiency of its own fan.</p>
<p>In addition to the GermGuardian AC4825, you&#8217;ll find a dual control panel with AC5000E, with a single UV light button, on/off button, fan speed switch and LED filter change indicator.</p>
<p>The Germguardian AC4825 is extremely quiet when placed on a low speed fan and a little noisy when you&#8217;re a high-speed enthusiast. If there&#8217;s one thing missing, it&#8217;s a remote control.</p>
<p>With about 7 pounds, GermGuardian AC4825 air purifier is much lighter than the CDAP4500BCA which weighs 9.45 pounds. With a relatively small size, the GermGuardian AC4825 is compact and therefore easy to carry around in the home.</p>
<h2>GERMGUARDIAN AC4825 SOUND</h2>
<p>By using exactly the same 3 fan speeds as its big brother, the noise level of the GermGuardian AC4825 is much better than that of the modern device which generally contains 5 fan speeds. A smaller size reduces the size of the fan and thus reduces noise, but only at the highest fan speed.</p>
<ul>
<li>The low speed (#1) is really quiet enough, and useful to sleep when you are a light sleeper.</li>
<li>Medium (#2) is really not that strong. It&#8217;s barely noticeable when I&#8217;m watching YouTube or listening to audio.</li>
<li>High (#3) has a moderate amount of sound and can be masked by the sound of your TV or radio. However, it is quite striking, but not very strong.</li>
</ul>
<p>At its lowest setting, the noise level of the GermGuardian AC4825 remains at 40 decibels, which is higher than most standard air purifiers on the market. For example, the AeraMax 300 is only 35 decibels, the SilverOnyx can only be 25 decibels, or the Winix 5300-2 with only 28 decibels.</p>
<p>By pressing the UV button at the top, you can activate the sprouting attribute. It is an excellent addition that is not found in many competing products.</p>
<p>In addition, it is perfectly quiet and does not cause any noise or side effects.</p>
<p>When the lamp is on, the blue cut on the underside of the silver shirt section lights up in blue to indicate that the lamp is working. This technology uses the science of ultraviolet (UV) light to influence microbes in the atmosphere, combined with titanium dioxide to remove pollutants in the air.</p>
<p>However, when you switch to the maximum setting, the noise level of the GermGuardian AC4825 is only 55 decibels (db), which is lower than the 60 db current of the GermGuardian AC5000 or GermGuardian AC5350B. This is still close to the noise level of the public restaurant, or one air conditioner per 100 feet. But even better is better.</p>
<p>However, the sound level of the air purifier has not performed very well in quiet places, you will always notice a very clear sound, especially when you are running at the maximum setting. Therefore, we believe that GermGuardian AC4825 is still not acceptable for your room or office.</p>

<h2>What are the disadvantages of owning GermGuardian AC4825?</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Not suitable for large rooms</strong>. This system is only ideal for small parts. Their air cleaning efficiency is reduced when the device is used in relatively large rooms.</li>
<li><strong>Cosmetic fragrance</strong>. A large number of consumers pointed out that the machine produces an unpleasant &#8220;plastic&#8221; odour. Such users believe that a system designed to purify and refresh the air should not produce odours.</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the main disadvantages of the GermGuardian AC4825 is that it has a small window at the top that allows UV light to pass through. This blue light is really disturbing in a dark room. It&#8217;s not perfect to try to see a movie or sleep. And this light is safe to look at, it&#8217;s just a poorly thought out design feature. The easiest way to avoid blue light is to turn off the UV rays by pressing the top button, but you don&#8217;t get the benefits of UV rays that sterilize your air! Nowadays some people put dark tape on the window, which blocks the light very well. I advise you to use electric tape or black canvas tape.</p>
<p>Some people are worried about ozone emissions from the GermGuardian AC4825&#8217;s UV-C lamps. Luckily, that&#8217;s not a problem. UV lamps emit light at a lower frequency than that likely to emit ozone. The GermGuardian AC4825 is an ozone free machine!</p>
<p>Some men and women who bought the GermGuardian AC4825 say that they have red flashing light directly from the box. Don&#8217;t worry, there&#8217;s no problem with your machine. All you have to do is reset the light by pressing and holding the button for 3 to 5 seconds. When the indicator is reset, it&#8217;s better to go!</p>
<p>Another common complaint that some people have is their GermGuardian AC4825 comes with an air intake problem. They say the air only comes from one side of the machine. There&#8217;s nothing wrong with the machine, that&#8217;s how it works! The design of the fan inside means that it only blows air on one side.</p>
<p>In general, this air purifier is remarkable. It contains a genuine HEPA filter and activated carbon pre-filters, which process most household odours, but which are bad for removing smoke and VOCs. In addition, this unit is not designed for large areas, so you can&#8217;t expect it to purify the atmosphere in large spaces.</p>
<h2>How does it relate to others?</h2>
<h3>GermGuardian AC4825 versus AC5000</h3>
<p>The only difference between the GermGuardian AC4825 and the AC5000 is its size and cost. The AC5000 is 28 inches high compared to the AC4825 22 inches high. The manual indicates that the AC5000 can be used in rooms up to 193 square meters, approximately 14 by 14 meters. It goes without saying that most people today, like the AC4825, use it in even larger rooms. I would recommend 1 AC5000 for every 900 square metres of floor space. The &#8220;big brother&#8221; of the AC4825, the AC5000E is almost identical, with the exception of the space management and the UV-C lamp. It is also an excellent addition to your home. Don&#8217;t forget to take a look at my detailed comparison if you are considering the AC4825, but you do have a lot of space!</p>
<p>In case you don&#8217;t know, the AC5000 is almost identical except for its size (almost 28″ high) and a much better protection of the component. It is also an excellent large format air purifier and is recommended for rooms up to 193 square meters (medium-large).</p>
<p>Same as the AC4825, it has a UV-C pathogens kill attribute, although the layout of the lamp differs.</p>
<h3><strong>GermGuardian AC4825 vs AC5350</strong></h3>
<p>The difference here is a bit of quality and size. The AC5350 is exactly the same size as the AC5000 in 28 inches high and can handle about 1000 square meters of floor space. One of the advantages of this AC5350 within the AC4825 is that it is a beautiful digital display that gives you more control. The AC5350 has five power levels, while the AC4825 has only three power levels. And I know that beauty is in the eye of the viewer, but the AC5350 is just a more aesthetic model. Of course, you pay a lot more for these extra functions.</p>
<h3><strong>GermGuardian AC4825 vs AC4100 from GermGuardian</strong></h3>
<p>There is a big difference between the GermGuardian AC4825 and the AC4100. The AC4100 is extremely small, with only 11 inches. That&#8217;s half the height of this AC4825. The small AC4100 is designed to sit on a table or desk and is designed for confined spaces. The AC4100 should only be used for distances of approximately 100 square meters.</p>
<h3><strong>GermGuardian AC4825 vs AC5250PT</strong></h3>
<p>GermGuardian&#8217;s AC5250PT is very closely connected to the AC5350 and is 28 inches high, compared to the AC4825 in 22 inches, allowing it to clean a larger area. In addition, it has a digital display and other configurations, such as five power levels. The AC5250PT can also clean a part a little faster than the AC4825.</p>
<h3><strong>GermGuardian AC4825 vs AC4900CA</strong></h3>
<p>The only difference between these two units seems to be the classification. The AC4900CA is slightly more minimalist and geometric than the AC4825.</p>
<h3><strong>GermGuardian AC4825 vs Winix 5500</strong></h3>
<p>There are several differences between the two models. First of all, you&#8217;ll notice that they look very different. Winix is flat and wide, while GermGuardian is high and thin. Winix also has some additional features compared to GermGuardian, such as a timer and setting the power too high. One significant difference is that the Winix has a remote control so you can control the power setting anywhere in the house. However, these differences have a price. You can buy almost two GermGuardians for the purchase price of this Winix 5500.</p>
<h3><strong>GermGuardian AC4825 vs Purezone</strong></h3>
<p>Purezone and GermGuardian AC4825 have a number of differences. The Purezone is a desktop or tabletop model designed for small spaces. Although much smaller, Purezone is slightly more expensive than the AC4825.</p>
<h3><strong>GermGuardian AC4825 vs Honeywell HFD-120-Q</strong></h3>
<p>There are big differences between Honeywell and GermGuardian. The big difference is that Honeywell doesn&#8217;t have a HEPA filter. The GermGuardian HEPA filter captures 99.97% of the particles, while the Honeywell filter does not. The advantage of the Honeywell is that the filter is permanent and washable.</p>
<h3><strong>GermGuardian AC4825 vs Honeywell 50250-S</strong></h3>
<p>The big difference between GermGuardian and Honeywell is that Honeywell does not use UV light to kill bacteria and fungi as GermGuardian does. The Honeywell 50250-S uses a HEPA filter like the GermGuardian and does a great job with particle filtration, but does not have the germination power of this AC4825.</p>
<h3>GermGuardian AC4825 vs the Honeywell HPA100</h3>
<p>The closest competitor to the AC4825 is in my opinion the Honeywell HPA100. It has some characteristics that GermGuardian does not have, even if it is missing in some areas. It is also available in a white version. The room size policy is 155 square metres.</p>
<p>Some of the attributes that the HPA100 offers to the AC4825 are not:</p>
<ul>
<li>Electronic touch control</li>
<li>High-speed turbo control</li>
<li>Automatic switch-off timer</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>GermGuardian AC4825 vs Coway AP-1512HH</strong></h3>
<p>GermGuardian AC4825 vs Coway AP-1512HH germ protector vs Coway<br />
The Coway AP-1512HH uses a HEPA filter, just like GermGuardian, but has no UV light to kill germs and fungi. This is an important advantage for GermGuardian and for people with allergies or who are vulnerable to airborne diseases. 1 An important difference between these two models is that Coway is much more expensive than GermGuardian. You can buy almost 3 AC4825 for the purchase price of a Coway.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The GermGuardian AC4825 is a great product! The AC4825 can clean and purify the air in a way that its rivals cannot and for a price that rivals cannot beat. After installing the GermGuardian AC4825, the atmosphere in your home will be clean and tidy in less than a day. This thing is ideal for homes that smoke, people with pets, people with allergies, or just anyone who wants to have a much better life in their own home. I recommend the GermGuardian AC4825 three in an air purification system if you are looking for an air purifier for your home.</p>
<h2>Where to buy GermGuardian AC4825 and how much does it cost?</h2>
<p>GermGuardian AC4825 is available in most stores. You can find it in Walmart, Target, Lowes, Best Buy and Amazon. It is priced at $99.99, but you can usually find it cheaper on Amazonia, where costs can fluctuate. To get the GermGuardian AC4825 on Amazon, click below.</p>
<h2>FAQ &#8211;</h2>
<h3>Does the AC4825 produce ozone?</h3>
<p>Some people wonder if air purifiers can cause headaches. As I explain in more detail in this informative article, a filter-based air conditioner, as you can see here, does not produce emissions that can cause headaches or other unpleasant reactions.</p>
<p>The UV-C option is completely closed and you do not risk being exposed to the UV rays of the skin. The AC4825 is completely safe and healthy because it does not create dangerous ozone levels.</p>
<p>The truth is that it generates 1/20th of the amount deemed acceptable by Health Canada&#8217;s 2010 guideline based on acceptable exposure levels and time.</p>
<p>You are completely safe and don&#8217;t have to worry about ozone when you use it.</p>
<h3>How difficult can it be to change the filter?</h3>
<p>Filter replacement is easy and only takes a few seconds. I was pleasantly surprised with how easy it is.</p>
<p>Basically, it’s just a few simple steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Press the release latch on the back of the cover.</li>
<li>Pull the cover down and remove it (there are 2 tabs on the bottom of the slots).</li>
<li>Pull out the filter with your fingers and remove it by pulling it down.</li>
<li>Replace the filter with the opposite movement.</li>
<li>Place the cover tabs on the bottom.</li>
<li>Turn the cover upwards and replace the release latch.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Why is the blue or red light flashing when I turn on the air purifier and how can I turn it off?</h3>
<p>The air purifier comes with indicator lights that blink automatically when it is time to change the UV-C filter or lamp. If the LEDs flash the first time you turn on your air purifier, reset the GermGuardian AC4825 by pressing and holding the UV button for at least 3 to 5 minutes before the LEDs stop flashing. Your air purifier is now set up and ready to use!</p>
<h3>Do I want to change my filter?</h3>
<p>Yes, it is proposed to change the filter (FILTER B/FLT4825) every six to nine months, depending on the use of this air purifier.</p>
<h3>How long is your warranty?</h3>
<p>The warranty is 3 years. For more information about warranty, please refer to the warranty section of your GermGuardian AC4825 documentation.</p>
<h3>What is CADR?</h3>
<p>CADR stands for &#8220;Clean Air Delivery Rate&#8221;, which suggests that the amount of filtered air supplied by an air purifier is the amount of filtered air. The CADR ratings show the effectiveness of the air purifier in capturing fine particles of harmful elements such as cigarette smoke and plant pollen in the room.</p>
<h3>How do I know when to change the filter?</h3>
<p>It is wise to change the combined filter every six months, depending on usage, to maintain a maximum level of air purification. After changing the filter indicator from white to dark grey or black, the filter must be replaced with a new filter. If the filter is still white, it does not need to be replaced. You can buy GermGuardian AC4825 filters on Amazon here.</p>
<h3>What is UV-C light?</h3>
<p>UV-C is part of the spectrum of ultraviolet light that is filtered through the global atmosphere. The &#8220;C&#8221; stands for the special frequency of UV light that eliminates germs and bacteria.</p>
<h3>Why is UV-C light so powerful?</h3>
<p>UV-C light is extremely effective in penetrating thin-walled germs such as viruses and bacteria. Light changes the genetic structure of the germ and they will eventually die.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>A powerful air purifier you&#8217;ll love to own. No wonder it&#8217;s one of today&#8217;s most popular models.</p>
<p>The GermGuardian AC4825 is a simple tower air cleaner with simple operation and good air purification capacity. Some features are missing compared to more expensive models, but it is a better value for money. The coverage of the rooms (medium-sized rooms, 155 square meters) is much better than that of most competitors with similar prices. The quality and construction are very good; maintenance is not difficult to perform. It&#8217;s a quiet and pleasant purifier to hear in my own tests.</p>
<p>Pre-filter/HEPA filters work well to remove particles and odours from the air. The UV-C attribute is a bonus alternative for killing germs. One of the most popular air purifiers of today, it is a sensible and sensible choice for fresh air. The GermGuardian AC4825 is a highly effective air purifier that is ideal for relatively small spaces. This system uses different mechanisms to ensure that different types of contaminants are removed before they reach your nostrils.</p>
<p>Regardless of the criticism levelled at this air purifier, it seems that the vast majority of users are satisfied with their purchase. As indicated in these lines, this ENERGY STAR certified device works so well to purify the air that some have said that after many hours of use it can make a difference in air quality. Other people have discovered it, which really helps to control the smells of pets and cooking. Apparently, it makes the atmosphere much easier to breathe. Other notable features of the GermGuardian AC4825 are its modern design and the fact that it runs smoothly at the low fan speed.</p>
<p>It has been optimized to provide your room with fresh, clean air, free of dust particles, fungi, fungi, fungi, smoke, odors, viruses, pollen and germs, to name but a few. Regardless of the relatively compact range and the occasional plastic smell you can smell in the first few days of the application, we are very satisfied with our evaluations and recommend them to you.</p>
<p>GermGuardian is one of the most reliable manufacturers of air purifiers. They produce quality products that fit within your budget. The AC4825 is available to almost everyone and its quality is unrivalled. Most users are happy with the machine because it absorbs dust, odours and other air pollutants well.</p>

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Coway is an innovative South Korean company that produces products to help purify the home. They create a lot of water and air cleaners. And in cities like Seoul and Hong Kong, air purifiers are required.</p>
<p>The Coway AP-1512HH uses four filtration phases to purify the air, which can be higher than the standard two to obtain air purifiers. The Coway also includes a timer, an air quality indicator and automatic modes, as well as ecological modes to save electricity.</p>
<p>The AP-1512HH is designed to cover long distances. It can clean rooms of about 528 square meters. This is 23 feet by 23 feet, a huge amount of space to get an air purifier!</p>
<p>The main characteristic of the Coway is that it looks so good. The modern and elegant case is available in a choice of white or black and seems to be modeled after a giant iPod Shuffle. If only the Coway can play the sound.</p>
<p>Coway&#8217;s old model <strong>Coway AP-1512HH</strong> remains a complete beautiful appearance and there is still a lot of fuel in the tank in case you find the second best air purifier until 2019, but many newer Coway units are easily available. Nowadays we are going to do a <strong>Coway AP-1512HH review</strong> to determine why you want to stay with this air purifier.</p>
<p>In this article we investigated all air purifiers under these segments. Besides, we promise:</p>

<p>The Coway AP-1512HH uses a multi-layer filter system to purify the air flowing through your device. The Coway is equipped with some of the most reliable mechanisms to ensure that the air released is clean and tidy. In addition to removing contaminants, this air purifier eliminates odors to make sure your room just has fresh, clean air.</p>
<p><strong>HEPA technology</strong> is one of the most efficient filtration techniques used by air purifiers. The Coway AP-1512HH uses the real HEPA filter system to purify the air that passes through it.</p>
<p>This highly reliable filtration system removes up to 99.97% of air pollutants. With this <strong>air purifier</strong> in your home, you can be sure that the air in every room is free of dust, pollen, mold spores, animal skin flakes, and more.</p>
<p>The AP-1512HH comes with an air detection system that determines the level of air pollution. If the system runs for half an hour without even detecting air pollutants, the system immediately stops the fan to save electricity. This wise technology ensures that the air in any room is clean and tidy and is also great for your wallet.</p>
<p>Air purifiers authorized by the AHAM certification program are authorized and confirmed by an independent laboratory, which ensures that purchasers of air cleaners can work according to the company&#8217;s claims regarding the recommended room size and minimize 3 medium sized household particles: cigarette smoke, dust and pollen, also known as the <strong>Clean Air Delivery Rate (CADR)</strong>.</p>
<p>Coway is your number one Korean manufacturer for air cleaners without a design. With 30 years in this industry, this is truly a sign for the life care industry in Korea. They also rank first in Korea for market share and brand recognition in the consumer electronics sector. A reputable brand is, of course, the very first reason that is taken into account when purchasing a product or technology. The Coway AP-1512HH, in fact, meets all of an individual&#8217;s air quality needs in their home.</p>
<h2>Our analysis and evaluation results</h2>
<p>The <strong>Coway AP-1512HH</strong> is one of the most efficient in most categories, but the lifetime costs are around the average. It is a rare product that is both at the front of the area, which does not have to pay any premium to get this high-end performance.</p>
<h2>Performance Responses</h2>
<p>Supported by a high-end air filter and a silent fan, the Coway AP-1512HH was the most efficient in our tests, as you can see in the table above.</p>
<p>We calculate all our scores on the basis of a number of evaluations that we divide into different test parameters. The following sections discuss how the Coway AP-1512HH performed in each of these parameters.</p>
<h2>Performance of the air purifier</h2>
<p>The Coway AP-1512HH belonged to the top 4 models that scored 8 out of 10 in our air cleaning tests. Each of these models was able to remove almost 100% of the airborne particles in our living room of smoky test chamber of 360 square feet room.</p>
<h2>Coway AP-1512HH Price</h2>
<p>Like Winix &#8211; yet another South Korean manufacturer &#8211; Coway focuses on a very wide range of consumers, ranging from ordinary low-end air purifiers to high-quality high-end air purifiers. We understand very well the tendency of these South Korean producers to purify each dish with their own taste with air purifiers.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s no secret that Coway had to do something big with this air purifier, to release something to stop the progression of extra low speed air purifiers. Actually I didn&#8217;t expect the Coway AP-1512HH wouldn&#8217;t be that big. Yes, there are still some elements that prevent it from becoming the ideal air purifier, but jumping on the podium from the very beginning is really a very remarkable achievement.</p>
<p>Today, however, it has fallen significantly, with the launch of these new AIRMEGA lovers and the AIRMEGA 400S, the brand&#8217;s flagship. This makes Coway AP-1512HH stand one of the lower range air purifiers, with an attractive price of about $199. The unit is available in two colours &#8211; a dark black and a white colour. If you are trying to find a contrast, you should inspect the Honeywell HPA300 &#8211; the American manufacturer&#8217;s engine. Whether the Blueair Sense+ is also a great choice, packing with Smart features with exactly the same performance with our Coway AP-1512HH.</p>
<p>Maybe the Coway AP-1512HH is really what we deserve. Get a standard air purifier in at a very affordable price.</p>
<p>Top Coway AP-1512HH is currently working on the&#8230;</p>
<p>Coway AP-1512HH powerful air purifier with real HEPA and Eco Mode from Black Edition.</p>
<p>The #1 Amazon Hot New Release #1 for HEPA air purifiers. With a 4-stage filter system and a durable pre-filter, this air purifier can clean all contaminants in a room of 361 square meters.</p>
<h2>What are the costs of the filters, where can I get them and how often should they be replaced?</h2>
<p>When you buy your air purifier, I recommend that you purchase a replacement Coway filter package for AP-1512HH. The replacement filter set is excellent because it is a bundle that comes with only two carbon pre-filters and a replacement HEPA filter. This is all you need for a whole year in one package.</p>
<p>Most air purifiers require you to buy carbon and HEPA filters and it can be expensive. The Coway replacement filter set for your AP-1512HH can be purchased in some places on the Internet, such as in the Bed bath and beyond and in the Amazon. Normally it costs about $50, which is not bad for a year of clean air.</p>
<p>You can keep your filters clean by vacuuming them with a brush for airborne pollutants in auto mode. Vacuum the micromesh filter only every fortnight, then vacuum the carbon filter and HEPA filter every month.</p>
<h2>What is the guarantee?</h2>
<p>The Coway AP-1512HH includes a 3-year warranty.</p>
<h2>How can the Coway AP-1512HH work?</h2>
<p>Like many other air purifiers, the Coway AP-1512HH Mighty air purifier contains a carbon filter and a real HEPA filter. However, the Coway contains two extra steps that many cleaners do not have. At the front of the carbon layer there is a micronet layer and an ionizer that supports the HEPA filter.</p>
<p>The micro-network coating is made of metal and can be used to capture solid particles, dust and animal hair. This coating is not difficult to clean and extends the life of their carbon and HEPA filters. This coating can be very easy to remove, so that the dust falls into the bin.</p>
<p>The next layer is the coating of the activated carbon filter. This layer holds larger particles like pollen and rabbit dust that go through the net, but the main purpose is to clean the air from odors. Activated carbon is a universal filter that is also known for eliminating odours. In fact, there are a few shoe soles that use active carbon to eliminate the smell of smelly feet.</p>
<p>The air then passes through the original HEPA filter. It is the coating that makes it possible to carry out the actual heavy lifting by filtering dust, pet hair and even smoke. The U.S. Department of Energy checks all actual HEPA filters to make sure they can filter 99.97% of the particles larger than 0.3 microns. This means that this filter is large enough to catch cigars and cigarette smoke.</p>
<p>The ionizer is the last step that the air goes through until it is blown into the room. The ionizer has a negative charge of air pollutants. These harmful particles then bind to the positively charged dust particles that float in the air, which then become too heavy and sink into the ground. With the ionizer running, you will see that there is more dust on each of the surfaces in the room. Then why do you want this?</p>
<p>Well, because the whole purpose of this Coway AP-1512HH is to purify the air! Instead of the dust that floats in the air to breathe in, it is deposited on the ground, where it can be sucked in or dusted off. The ionizer can be switched on or off in case you do not need this attribute. Many people nowadays prefer not to use ionisers because they are worried about them. Even the Coway AP-1512HH emits a very small amount of ozone as soon as the ionizer is present, but this amount is not noticeable.</p>
<h2>Coway Filters AP-1512HH</h2>
<p>Almost perfect. This is the best way to explain the filtration power of the Coway AP-1512HH.</p>
<p>In the low-end segment, most air cleaner manufacturers have to sacrifice something &#8211; the air filter, the noise level or even the electric fan. In the Coway AP-1512HH, surprisingly enough, there is absolutely no sacrifice. To compete with Winix with its PlasmaWave technology, Coway has developed an additional air purification process that is sufficient to maintain an average level. Let&#8217;s take a look at the 4-step filtering of the Coway AP-1512HH:</p>
<ol>
<li>Pre-filter &#8212; A washable pre-filter can help you to capture large particles of contaminants, pet hair, body hair and mold. Don&#8217;t forget that this pre-filter is waterproof and therefore durable in use.</li>
<li>Active carbon filter &#8212; This filter does its best to capture and interrogate harmful gasoline to keep your environment fresh and odorless.</li>
<li>True HEPA Filter &#8212; The high-quality composite HEPA filter that captures 99.97% of contaminants, virus particles, pollen, fungi and parasites up to 0.3 microns.</li>
<li>Ionizer &#8212; Critical ionization promotes cleaning power and cools the air. Can be switched on/off.</li>
</ol>
<p>Little has changed in the energy of Coway air purifiers, but this is still considered one of the best True HEPA air purifiers in the world. To check the performance score of the Coway AP-1512HH, I used a Levoit LV-PUR131 of $199 and a Honeywell HPA600B of $699. The end result is actually amazing, as the Coway AP-1512HH and Honeywell HPA600B can capture 99.97% of the particles as small as 0.3 microns, while the Levoit LV-PUR131 offers 99.9% lower efficiency.</p>
<h3>1. Pre-filter</h3>
<p>No longer a common feature in today&#8217;s price-sensitive market, the durable washable or vacuumable fiberglass pre-filter does a great job of capturing larger dust particles until another filter comes into place. The filter is a big advantage with the air purifier.</p>
<p>Many manufacturers have eliminated this pre-filter to reduce costs, but Coway has left it unchanged. This filter is reliable and focused on the largest particles such as dust and animal hair. In addition, this filter extends the life of other filters in the system by simply preventing them from becoming clogged with larger particles. Finally, this filter can also be washable.</p>
<h3>2. Odour filter</h3>
<p>Then, in accordance with the carbon filter, which does not work as expected. These odour filtration systems, although thick, may contain less carbon and are semi-transparent when exposed to light. Although the Coway is excellent at removing dust and germs, it will not impress anyone with its odor control.</p>
<p>Odour filters are also called active carbon filters. These filters can be effective in reducing odours due to the chemical and physical structure of this carbon. Activated carbon is a very porous substance with the distinctive ability to deal with pollutants at the atomic level, which makes it possible to consume certain substances because they come into contact with the filter.</p>
<h3>3. Genuine HEPA filter</h3>
<p>An original HEPA filter completes the Coway filter range. Now that all these brands are no longer using their old product, in our opinion the supply of and access to filters is more important than the price of the filters. The AP-1512HH requires the replacement of this original HEPA filter every year and 6 weeks for the carbon filter. Surprisingly, this short replacement period offers many advantages for retailers to maintain their stock levels.</p>
<p>High efficiency soot filters will be the standard Gold niches. HEPA filters are made of an ultra-fine fibrous material that targets contaminants in microscopic quantities. They are so powerful that they are recommended by the environment for disease control to tackle germs and other toxic airborne contaminants.</p>
<p>HEPA filters target a wide range of contaminants and are particularly useful for people suffering from asthma or allergies, each of which can be activated by the particles that this filter is designed to remove.</p>
<p>A filter switch timer that lights up an indicator light when certain operating hours reach a certain point. Coway&#8217;s 1-year replacement kit, part number 3304899, contains 1 HEPA filter and 2 active carbon filters. The filter package sells for $49.99 cheaply and is available at Amazon.com (check out the latest price here).</p>
<h3>Negative ionizer</h3>
<p>Then comes the ionizer, it&#8217;s a simple negative ion emitter, but it&#8217;s called &#8220;Coway Vital Ion Technology&#8221;. Another switch switches the ionizer on and off. In the following paragraphs we will discuss each phase of the Coway AP-1512HH Mighty Air Purifier filtering process.</p>
<h2>Coway AP-1512HH Coway Design and size</h2>
<p>Well, it&#8217;s like Coway makes extreme changes to industrial design every year, or even wants to make many changes in a year.</p>
<p>And this is exactly the case&#8230; Coway AP-1512HH only shares the same concept and minimum level AP-0512NH. Honestly, I don&#8217;t mind at all. The Coway AP-1512HH was one of the most beautiful air purifiers ever.</p>
<p>The front and back are covered with vinyl, but the Coway AP-1512HH looks even more luxurious than the Winix 5500-2 or even the Coway AP-0512NHH. Place the Coway AP-1512HH next to an iPod and you&#8217;d be surprised if you saw the resemblance. There are many air inlets under the front plastic plate to help bring contaminated air into the air filtration process of this unit.</p>
<p>In addition, we have 5 function keys at the top of the air purifier. Like all traditional air cleaners, the Coway AP-1512HH comes with an air outlet grille to bring the brand new air to an environment.</p>
<p>Out of the box, the Coway AP-1512HH is a really great device to take a look at, with a height of 18.3 inches and a diameter of 16.8 inches. It is compact but tasteful, with a transparent feeling of superior quality when you look at it.</p>
<p>However, it doesn&#8217;t feel like the most expensive on the market &#8211; it doesn&#8217;t matter what kind of Coway pattern is provided to charge this air purifier, it doesn&#8217;t come in the plan. However, it feels like a system that can be mentioned in exactly the same breath because the Honeywell HPA300 and Blueair Sense + can be mentioned in the same breath in terms of construction quality.</p>
<p>Coway hasn&#8217;t changed the timeless layout of the Korean air purifiers with two handles on each side. However, at 12.3 pounds, this air purifier at the level with Levoit LV-PUR131 is bold and is lighter compared to many air purifiers in its own homeland, including Winix WAC9500 or Winix 5500-2. The air purifier at Levoit LV-PUR131 level is bold and is lighter compared to many air purifiers in its own state, including Winix WAC9500 or Winix 5500-2.</p>
<p>This first-class performance is enhanced especially by a Smart Smart Smart True HEPA filter, which can be made from this high quality fabric. An essential ionizer can be crucial in discharging a cloud of energetic ions to capture allergens hidden around the actual HEPA filter. This air purification system is exactly what makes Rabbit Air BioGS 2.0 so effective, and again it benefits the Coway AP-1512HH in another level of air filtration.</p>
<p>This first-class performance is enhanced especially by a Smart Smart Smart True HEPA filter, which can be made from this high quality fabric. An essential ionizer can be crucial in discharging a cloud of energetic ions to capture allergens hidden around the actual HEPA filter. This air purification system is exactly what the powerful Rabbit Air BioGS 2.0 creates, and it promotes the Coway AP-1512HH in a different level of air filtration.</p>
<h2>Coway AP-1512HH Sound</h2>
<p>As if cleaning the upper recess wasn&#8217;t enough, the Coway was also the quietest operator among our test models. He scored a 9 out of 10 in an evaluation that was dozens of times lower than the 4th place.</p>
<p>If the setting is high, the laoway produces an average-high spinning It&#8217;s a bit loud, but somehow the pitch tends to fade in the background, and we didn&#8217;t think it would interrupt audio pleasures like listening to the radio or watching the TV. If you use it in your bedroom, it can actually be twice as effective as a beautiful white noise machine. Other models that seemed equally innocent in their own high configurations were the Blueair Pure 211 and the Levoit LV-PUR131.</p>
<p>The Coway fan has a Big Deal of Energy, but produces a sound that is soft enough not to disturb your Netflix binge viewing session.</p>
<p>Pull the Coway down to moderate the pitch pawls and lower the volume. This deep spinning is almost silent, but it&#8217;s still clear. It&#8217;s like the quiet buzz that keeps coming out of a fridge. If you click on it to reduce the size of the Coway, the Coway is almost silent. You&#8217;ll probably forget it&#8217;s on, even if you sit still and read only one novel.</p>
<p>For review, an air cleaner designed for the bedroom, Coway AP-1512HH must meet the strict requirements to not be noisy. Many bedroom centred air purifiers take full advantage of the Coway AP-1512HH to produce a terrible white sound, a soothing ambient sound to help people fall asleep. You must carefully choose an air purifier in your bedroom, otherwise you will be kept awake continuously at night.</p>
<p>The Coway AP-1512HH has only 3 fan speeds, with a background noise level of 24.4 decibels. It&#8217;s just the sound level of that whisper, even in real life you hardly have the ability to listen to anything. Even at its highest setting at 54 decibels (db), the Coway AP-1512HH produces fantastic white noise with a calming noise from the fan. That is why Coway AP-1512HH is currently the best bedroom air purifier in 2019.</p>
<h2>How do I use the Coway AP-1512HH?</h2>
<p>The Coway AP-1512HH powerful air purifier includes 5 speed settings, 3 speed settings, automatic mode and eco mode. Like many air purifiers, it is low, moderate and has high speeds. The minimum speed is almost silent and is ideal for watching movies, studying or sleeping. Medium looks like a low white noise. Some people may like to sleep and use it all day long. High looks like a fan that rotates high and pushes enough air to make you feel like you&#8217;re putting your hands in front of a window. The ionizer can be used at almost any speed or in car and eco modes.</p>
<p>The automatic and green modes work essentially the same way, and they are very intelligent. In automatic mode, the Coway AP-1512HH corrects the fan speed according to the level of air pollution. There is a small sensor on the front of the machine under a lid. You can clean the detector with a cotton swab about once every two weeks to make sure it remains accurate. If the unit is in automatic mode, if it finds clean air for 30 minutes, it switches to eco mode and switches off before the air is polluted again.</p>
<p>This can be a very useful function for men and women who just want to place it and forget about it. In automatic mode, you can save a lot of energy and don&#8217;t have to worry about your preferences.</p>
<p>But how can the sensor be true? In automatic mode, it lights up when you blow out a nearby candle. That&#8217;s pretty impressive! The only disadvantage of automatic mode is when it detects air pollution and lights up when you don&#8217;t need it, for reviewple when you are watching a movie.</p>
<p>At the top of the unit there is a light that tells you how dirty the air is. If the light is blue, the air is clean; if it is purple, the air is moderately dirty; and if the light is red, the air is really dirty. This is a great way to really see the Coway AP-1512HH purify the air in your home as the color changes from red to purple to blue.</p>
<p>The Coway AP-1512HH also has a timer so you can use it for a specified time and it switches off automatically. The timer can be set to 1, 4 or 8 hours. This is very good for those who just want to drive their air purifier when they are at work or asleep. Plus, it&#8217;s great if you want to clean part of your house fast. Let&#8217;s say you burned a chicken on your kitchen &#8211; no problem, just connect it to the Coway and put it on top for an hour.</p>
<p>The Coway has a clear and simple interface. Many buttons on the top of the unit allow you to set the fan speed, turn the ionizer on and off and set a 1, 4 or 8 hour timer. Fan settings are low, moderate, high and environmentally friendly. In addition, it includes an integrated air quality meter, which means that it is possible to set the fan speed on car and allow the purifier to increase and decrease the surrounding air quality controllers.</p>
<p>We have discovered that, with good air quality, this job is the most accurate of all the jobs we have chosen. While other models with integrated air quality meters did not respond regularly to the increase in air pollutants, Coway continuously improved its fan speed when our outdoor air quality meter showed an increase in particulate matter in the air. At 12.7 lbs, the Coway isn&#8217;t particularly light, but it&#8217;s the thin carrying handles that make it pretty easy to manoeuvre.</p>
<p>One important feature of the AP-1512HH is that it pulls the air in at the front and bottom and upwards. This is great because you don&#8217;t have to worry too much about where you put it. As long as there&#8217;s room in the front and it&#8217;s visible upstairs, it should be good. I prefer air cleaners that blow the air upwards; this way it doesn&#8217;t blow newspapers everywhere with even clean air that can flow gently from the ceiling downwards.</p>
<p>There are only two lights and also a button on this machine. These are indicator lights to inform you whether both filters need to be replaced. Simply change the charcoal filter every six weeks and the HEPA filter every six weeks. If you are at the top when cleaning and vacuuming your own filters, in addition to washing your own micronet filter, you can keep making these filters much longer.</p>
<h2>Coway AP-1512HH AP-1512HH Electricity consumption</h2>
<p>One of the most frequently asked questions is: &#8220;Do air purifiers use a lot of energy?&#8221;. In fact, the air purifier has to be used for a very long time to be more effective. And electricity consumption is just one of the important criteria for determining how much energy this air purifier will consume.</p>
<p>Get ready to be surprised, because the Coway AP-1512HH can already consume 4.9 watts of power thanks to this fantastic eco mode. This eco mode puts the air cleaner on standby (which consumes only 4.9 g) if it finds better air quality and there is absolutely no need to run the fan. It is safe to say that Coway AP-1512HH has become by far the most energy efficient air purifier in today&#8217;s industry. The absolute novelty in terms of energy saving: the rabbit&#8217;s air can simply reach a minimum of 5 grams.</p>
<p>The Coway AP-1512HH model fan differs from conventional air cleaning fans that make noise when you turn them on. The Coway has a quiet operation and runs smoothly in almost every corner of the apartment. With the high efficiency of the air purifier, you may wonder what the various side effects of the gadget are. You can be sure that you have no problems using this air purifier and that everyone in your home can operate it easily.</p>
<p>In addition to the simplicity of operation, this air purifier offers many environmentally friendly functions. As indicated on this light sensor model, the fan switches on or off automatically, depending on the pollutants in the ambient air. This invention not only saves on your energy bill, but also increases the number of people looking for environmentally friendly practices that can support the environment.</p>
<p>The particle detection system is in fact a powerful method for keeping all types of microbial progress outdoors. The system keeps you healthy and eliminates all kinds of unpleasant odours.</p>
<p>Who doesn&#8217;t want an energy-efficient air purifier that protects the environment? The Coway AP 1512HH is not only an alternative, but a perfect answer to the problems faced by many people. It has been described by many users since the lowest energy-consuming air purifier on the market.</p>
<p>With only 15.6 watts of operation at the lowest fan speed, you can be sure that this air purifier will go a very long way to reduce your energy bill. To visualize the electricity consumption, the 15.6 Watt consumption is converted to 2.1 Watt more than what incandescent lamps normally consume.</p>
<p>The Coway was really one of the most efficient models in our tests, with a consumption of only 0.01 kWh of power per hour of performance. This varies up to about $5.26 a year in many homes. However, the replacement filters are a bit expensive and we usually find them for $60, although there are sometimes cheaper alternatives.</p>
<p>The best replacement packaging is a single HEPA filter and 2 charcoal filters, which, according to the manufacturer&#8217;s recommendations, may be sufficient to last a year. The list price of $230 can also be slightly above average, which means you have to pay a little more in advance.</p>
<p>But if you continue to use this Coway AP-1512HH with the highest ventilation speed, the power consumption can be up to 78 watts. To date, the Winix WAC9500 consumes about 70 watts and the Honeywell HPA300 also increases to 130 watts. The Coway AP-1512HH may not be the best energy saver, but it is not the worst.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s think, for only 8 hours of use per afternoon, it usually costs you 10 to 30 dollars a year. Yeah, that&#8217;s exactly how you pay for a light bulb every year.</p>
<h2>Safety and certification</h2>
<p>With the 4-stage air filter system, the Coway AP-1512HH can purify the air in your room. But in the previous filtration measurement, &#8220;Vital Ion&#8221; ionizes the air molecules. The fees are then transferred to the pollutant particles to make it easier to remove these loaded particles during another air purification cycle. A very small percentage of ionised air has a variable effect on ozone formation, which can cause problems in very sensitive and debilitating lungs.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Coway has unveiled and obtained the California Air Resource Board (CARB) certification to prove that the air purifier generates less than 0.05 ppm of pumped molecules. Therefore, Coway AP-1512HH Coway is unlikely to cause respiratory problems. In addition, if you are really worried about this issue, you can turn off the &#8220;Vital Ion&#8221; ionizer.</p>
<p>A fantastic part of the Coway air purifier would be the energy consumption. Most large air purifiers use more than 60W in the cheapest mode, but the Coway uses only 5W. In fact, it is accredited by &#8220;Energy Star&#8221; for its very low energy consumption. This air purifier has no significant effect on your electrical charge, even if it is used 24 hours a day.</p>
<h2>Advantages and disadvantages</h2>
<h3>Advantages</h3>
<p>The Coway AP 1512HH is very efficient, with a CADR value of 210 for dust and particle cleaning, what better device would you receive for this price range? The air purifier contains at least a 4-stage air filter system that removes all kinds of dust and odours from your home.</p>
<p>From an air quality signal to a system that stops when the air purification is complete, the Coway is definitely designed to extract purifying air in a child&#8217;s play. It is not surprising that many users of the Coway AP 1512HH recently charge the latest Coway AP 1512HH with world-class work for air cleaners. This air purifier also has a celebrity who is &#8220;energy efficient&#8221; and most of its features are designed to ensure that you can cover the lowest potential energy bill.</p>
<h3>Disadvantages</h3>
<p>You will find different ratings when it comes to how noisy Coway AP-1512HH Mighty Air Purifier is. When the fan is running at high speed, it is often very noisy, but when it is running at low speed, it is quite quiet and you hardly hear it. There are many good things about this particular device, but one of the negative aspects is that it does not completely eliminate odors or chemical compounds from the air.</p>
<p>Moreover, the air quality indicator is often unreliable. The air purifier is very likely to increase the room temperature, which causes some kind of dent in the operation of the air purifier, in order to save energy in your home. The Coway AP-1512HH manages to reduce efficiency in large areas. The very important ionic component is not recommended for people with sensitive respiratory problems.</p>
<h2>How does it relate to each other?</h2>
<p>Coway AP-1512HH vs. AP-1012GH</p>
<p>These two models are similar in many ways. The two 4-stage filtration systems that use an ionizer both have a timer and an automatic mode to detect and react to air pollution. However, they differ in crucial places. The Coway AP-1012GH contains a HEPA filter that lasts three decades, while the AP-1512HH only lasts one year.</p>
<p>This makes the AP-1012GH easier for your set-it-and-forget-it types. Another difference is the amount of space for which each of them is assessed. The Coway AP-1512HH is valued at 528 square feet, while the AP-1012GH is valued at 355 square feet.</p>
<h3>Coway AP-1512HH vs. rabbit air</h3>
<p>The Coway AP-1512HH and Rabbit Air BioGS 2.0 have very similar filtration systems. Both have four-phase filtration systems that use a microgrid, activated carbon, HEPA filter and ionizer. One of the most important differences is that Rabbit Air has a more powerful active carbon filter.</p>
<p>This thicker filter should remove unpleasant odours better. Another difference is the price. The Rabbit Air costs about $150 more than the Coway. Filters are slightly more expensive, but they often have to be cleaned.</p>
<h3>Coway AP-1512HH vs. Winix 5500</h3>
<p>The Winix 5500 has only one filter that is smaller than the Coway. With the Coway you get a micro-network that protects the filters from large particles, while the Winix does not use the micro-network. On the other hand, Winix states that it is sufficient to replace the HEPA filter every 3 decades. They also claim that the HEPA filter is washable, but that washing can significantly reduce efficiency. I recommend that you wash it once or twice during the life of this filter.</p>
<p>The Winix can be built for smaller distances in 360 square meters instead of 528 square meters on the Coway. 1 thing that people seem to want about Winix is that it contains a remote control that you can use to change the fan speed and other configurations.</p>
<h3>Coway AP-1512HH vs. Germguardian AC4825</h3>
<p>GermGuardian uses a slightly different process than Coway&#8217;s to filter the air. Unlike Coway, GermGuardian doesn&#8217;t use an ionizer. The GermGuardian has an exaggerated measure that the Coway doesn&#8217;t have. After charcoal and HEPA filters, GermGuardian uses UV light to destroy all kinds of viruses and germs. This is very good for people who are worried not only about allergies, but also about other diseases.</p>
<p>However, the Coway beats the GermGuardian on the dimensions of the room, which is rated only for 155 square meters. Coway also contains some attributes that GermGuardian does not have, such as the automatic mode that adjusts the cleaning energy based on air pollution.</p>
<h2>Do I have to buy the Coway AP-1512HH?</h2>
<p>Yeah, no doubt about it. The Coway AP-1512HH is your best budget air purifier you can get now. This air purifier features a high quality and powerful air filtration process, an accurate intelligent sensor and quiet operation to serve you anywhere in your home.</p>
<ol>
<li>In case of serious allergies or allergies to air pollutants: the Coway AP-1512HH is good with the True HEPA filter and its own 4-stage air purification system.</li>
<li>If you want more performance or ventilation capacity to clean your room faster: it&#8217;s possible to look for the Honeywell HPA300 and Blue Pure 211 with a CADR value above 300 cfm.</li>
<li>If you want an air purifier with much better space protection: that the Alen Paralda and Alen T500 are much better at 500 square meters, you can also buy the Blue Pure 211 to easily pay for your 540 square meters room.</li>
<li>If you need an economic edition of the air purifier: it is possible to search for the Coway AP-0512NH or Honeywell HPA100. I have evaluated a reduced price development for your Winix 5300-2, Winix 5500-2 and Winix C535, so you shouldn&#8217;t turn down this opportunity either.</li>
<li>If you want a quieter air purifier: that the Coway AP-1512HH is really quiet for the price.</li>
<li>If you are really worried about the annual cost of the filter and the cost of energy: that the Coway AP-1512HH is one of the very economic choices for you.</li>
<li>If you like the extra features: You can choose between the GermGuardian CDAP5500BCA, Honeywell HPA250B and Blueair Sense+ for Smart Wifi connectivity and Smart Sensor features.</li>
