<p>In this guide we will discover the <strong>best mold air purifiers for home</strong>, office, garage and on the basis of different budgets.</p>
<p>You’ll find tracks everywhere, floating in the air, on your desk and in your home. There’s no way to completely prevent them. But inhaling mold spores can lead to medical problems. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) have found that people who are sensitive to mold may have upper respiratory tract symptoms, increased asthma symptoms and skin discomfort when exposed to mold and spores. The World Health Organization (WHO) has studied several studies that have also shown that the existence of mold is correlated with exacerbated respiratory symptoms and asthma symptoms.</p>
<p>In case you have ever needed to treat with mold in almost any capacity, you understand exactly how great a pain in the neck it can be. But what you may not understand is how harmful mold can be if it is a constant material.

<h2><span id="What_is_the_difference_between_a_mold_air_purifier_and_a_dehumidifier">What is the difference between a mold air purifier and a dehumidifier?</span></h2>
<p>A dehumidifier removes moisture from the air. If you’ve ever lived in a cold, damp house, you’ll understand the feeling of cold air humidity that you can practically feel your hands wet when you let them pass through the air. A dehumidifier removes and retains moisture. This helps to kill and reduce the total amount of mold in the room, since mold appreciates moisture.</p>
<p>An air purifier does not treat humidity. On the contrary, it brings air to the filter, eliminates airborne spores and releases clean, clean air. A dehumidifier has a bucket that collects moisture (it can be alarming to see exactly how far away).</p>
<p>The two can go hand in hand, but do not do exactly the same job or send out exactly the same results.</p>
<h2><span id="What_kind_of_mold_do_you_have_in_your_house">What kind of mold do you have in your house?</span></h2>
<p>There are more than 400,000 species of mold on Earth. Fortunately, only a thousand of them can live in a household. All these species are divided into three classes.</p>
<p>Allergens. All of these are only dangerous if you have allergies or respiratory problems, such as asthma. Young children are particularly vulnerable to airborne spores.</p>
<p>Pathogen. These are dangerous species that can cause infections. They don’t affect 100% healthy people, but when your immune system is affected, they can cause severe lung disease.</p>
<p>Toxic. This is really the most dangerous group that contains the famous black mold. This group can affect anyone. They suppress the immune system and can cause cancer. All these species create mycotoxins that are harmful to health when ingested or inhaled. It is possible to get side effects after touching them.</p>
<p>In our homes we are mainly confronted with five types of mold. They are:</p>
<ul><li>Alernaria – occurs on the nose, mouth and upper respiratory tract and can cause allergic reactions.</li>
<li>Aspergillus – Normally observed in extremely humid environments. It settles in house dust and can produce mycotoxins, which cause many lung diseases.</li>
<li>Cladosporium – This is a quick and easy way to remove fabrics, wood and other porous surfaces. It can cause hay fever and asthma.</li>
<li>Penicillium — likes to grow on the bottom, carpet and fiberglass insulation. It can cause asthma and allergies. Can produce mycotoxins.</li>
<li>Stachybotrys – Toxic form or black form that leads to mycotoxin and causes serious problems, such as lung bleeding. It is not as common in households as in the other four types of households. It can be applied on paper or wood, but perhaps not on tiles or concrete.</li>

Buying a unit that offers all the options listed below will help you ensure that your home remains free from harmful mold spores.</p>
<ol><li>True HEPA Filter</li>
</ol><p>The very first thing you want to make sure that the ambient air purifier has a True HEPA filter. This filter is vital because it can capture particles up to 0.3 microns. Includes all types of mold spores that can be found in your home. A device that has no real HEPA postage costs does not give you any assurance that it will help solve this problem. Avoid air cleaners that indicate “HEPA-like” or even “HEPA-like” or even “HEPA-type” because they are bad on some True HEPA devices.</p>
<ol start="2"><li>Ultra Violet Light</li>
</ol><p>Ultra Violet (UV) light can also be crucial because it kills mold spores. It works by using a beam of light to purify the spores and ruin their DNA makeup. UV light is contained in the air purifier without releasing light into the room. It’s an excellent backup system for your own True HEPA filter because it kills contaminants it can’t catch.</p>
<ol start="3"><li>Active Carbon Filter</li>
</ol><p>This filter can also be a must as it detects mold smells where the other two types are spreading – it removes mold smells. Activated carbon is excellent for absorbing toxic volatile organic compounds and microbial volatile organic compounds that cause mold. With this property, the mold odour will continue to exist.</p>
<ol start="4"><li>Cleaning quantities or speeds</li>
</ol><p>Iit is useful to have different ventilation speeds, as this allows you to control the speed at which the air has circulated. During the wet and cold months when the fungus comes out, it is possible to increase the fan speed as much as possible to obtain a complete cleaning. Then, during the warmer seasons, once you’ve figured out how to ventilate your home (i.e. available windows and sunlight), you can slow down the speed. Some air purifiers have an intelligent detector that evaluates the quality of the air and also adjusts the speed of the fan to the level of air pollution. (Levoit are great for offering such features).</p>
<ol start="5"><li>The space it could cover</li>
</ol><p>Air purifiers are designed to meet the specific dimensions of the space. For example, one model can handle the air in a 400 square meter space, while the other model can handle an area of 1000 square feet (instead of another space… but we won’t dwell on it). As long as the specifications clearly indicate the square meters, everything will be fine). Evaluate for which space you want your air purifier. Could it be a small room? A big garage? A medium-sized living room or a large open-plan office? Make sure your air purifier matches the invoice.</p>
<p>Buying an air purifier that has a combination of these three features is the golden ticket to a mold free and odorless home.</p>

<h2><span id="The_Best_Air_Purifiers_For_Mold_8211_Top-Picks">The Best <strong>Air Purifiers For Mold</strong> – Top-Picks</span></h2>
<p>An <strong>air purifier for mold</strong> in your own home and breathing in clean, fresh air is essential. That’s why it’s essential to keep reading and looking at the reviews of the 6 best products available in the industry today. They are not presented in a specific order, just select the order that suits you best.</p>
<h3><span id="ALEN_BREATHESMART_CLASSIC_LARGE_ROOM_AIR_PURIFIER">ALEN BREATHESMART CLASSIC LARGE ROOM AIR PURIFIER</span></h3>
<p>With the BreatheSmart air purifier from Alen, an area of 1100 m2…. Ft. is cleaned every 30 minutes. It was designed and built by NASA engineers using WhisperMax technology. In turbo mode, it therefore operates twice as quietly as most other products. This device is ideal for people with allergies. Thanks to this HEPA silver filter, generated with an antimicrobial compound, the growth of bacteria and mold is prevented.</p>
<p>This air purifier is known as air-smart because of the properties of Laser Smart technology. This innovative technology allows you to detect airborne particles up to 0.3 microns, and with this air quality indicator light you can always know the state of the air quality around you.</p>
<p>This device comes with a lifetime warranty. You don’t have to worry if this air purifier fits in your home, because the Alen BreatheSmart air purifier comes with 14 separate panels.</p>
<p>The pros:</p>
<ul><li>Silent operation and contains 4 alternatives to fan speed</li>
<li>Operates in automatic mode, where the fan speed is automatically adjusted.</li>
<li>Lifetime warranty</li>
<li>This air purifier absorbs smoke, cooking smells and pet smells with 1.5 lbs. of activated carbon.</li>
</ul><p>The Cons:</p>
<ul><li>Made of plastic and it looks a bit fragile.</li>
</ul><h3><span id="GermGuardian_3-in-1_True_Hepa_Air_Purifier_AC4825">GermGuardian 3-in-1 True Hepa Air Purifier (AC4825)</span></h3>
<p>This slim model features genuine HEPA filtration to remove mold spores, as well as a carbon filter to neutralise sharp smells. In addition, the UV-C light that zaps into the air has germs such as viruses (hence the name germs). However, I note that UV-C lamps are polarised and controversial because of the ozone problem.</p>
<p>Manufacturers have promised that their UV-C lamps will not produce ozone, but they do not have a shut-off switch in the event of a problem. It really is an excellent alternative to small apartments or special rooms because it is small enough to integrate discreetly. Moreover, it is cheap enough for you to buy more than you can put on your house, one in the basement and one in the bedroom.</p>
<p>This specific unit has UV-C technology that works to purify the air better than many of the air purifiers available on the market.</p>
<p>It is able to reduce the amount of germs, viruses, germs and even mold spores in the air.</p>
<p>This device also contains a HEPA filter that can hold 99.97% of the contaminants and dust from plant pollen, animal skins and much more.</p>
<p>This alone makes it worthwhile as some of these additional air filters available on the market require a much more frequent filter change.</p>
<p>The device has a flexible 3-speed adjustment that makes it powerful enough to filter medium sized parts.</p>
<p>It is easily one of the best air purification options on the market with possibilities that exceed the price point.</p>
<p>Main features :</p>
<ul><li>Genuine HEPA filtration</li>
<li>Carbon filter for smells</li>
<li>UV-C light to kill germs and pathogens (ideal for mold spores)</li>
<li>Great price (it changes, but usually below 150 dollars and often below 100 dollars).</li>
<li>Different speed quantities</li>

<h3><span id="Biota_BOT_MM208_Our_2019_Winner_For_Mold">Biota BOT MM208 – Our 2019 Winner For Mold</span></h3>
<p>As one of the best-known air purifiers in North America, it is easy to find a Biota Bot air purifier with almost all of the <strong>best air purifiers for mold and mildew</strong> list by 2019. To fully combat all mold, the Biota Bot MM208 is the best bet of today, with a great performance for the price.</p>
<p>Let’s see why Breathe Quality chose this iconic air purifier from the new nation Nebraska as the <strong>best air purifier for mold</strong>.</p>
<ol><li>Additional filters — The Biota Bot MM208 has an extremely efficient pre-filter. This washable pre-filter can help to effectively capture solid objects of contaminants and reduce the amount of mold spores. In addition, this air purifier also includes the Anion Feature – an ionizer that can increase the efficiency of freezing mold spores. This ionization function can be deactivated.</li>
<li>True HEPA Filter – The most powerful real HEPA filter to capture all microscopic particles such as mold spores and even viruses.</li>
<li>Active carbon filter – Reduces smells generated by mold.</li>
<li>UV-C light filter – the best UV-C light technology to kill bacteria, viruses and mold residues in the air.</li>
</ol><p>With an ideal 5-step air filter system with a potential for air filter types, the Biota Bot MM208 can destroy virtually any type of mold and mildew in your home air. We have conducted several extensive experiments to ensure that 100% of mold spores kill this air purifier. In general, on a scale of 0-10 it is difficult to fall below 9 with this air purifier.</p>
<p>Powerful filtration process is only one advantage, the Power Biota Bot MM208 fan from Power Biota can also work well. Therefore, this air purifier can easily cover a large area of 430 square meters. But a slightly smaller one uses a high fan power like this, the Biota Bot MM208 is likely to be quite noisy at its highest setting. Therefore, you should not use this air purifier while you are sleeping.</p>
<p>Like all high-end machines, the Biota Bot MM208 is equipped with an intelligent sensor that is required to automatically adjust the fan power to the air quality in real time. You also have a neat timer and a handy LED indicator for changing the filters.</p>
<p>And something else, with these expensive features, Biota Bot is a low-end device in this aggressive air purifier market. Isn’t that great for you?</p>
<p>Here are the advantages and disadvantages of the Biota Bot MM208:</p>
<p>PROS</p>
<ul><li>Best performance score for killing mold spores</li>
<li>Powerful air filtration process</li>
<li>Has intelligent features such as Smart Sensor</li>
<li>Coverage of a large room: 430 square meters</li>
<li>3 year warranty</li>
</ul><p>CONS</p>
<ul><li>-Noise in the highest position</li>
</ul><h2><span id="What_needs_to_be_done_to_remove_mold">What needs to be done to remove mold?</span></h2>
<p>Mold particles are small enough to pass through the eyelashes of your sinuses and also small enough to be easily exhaled so that they can nestle in your lung tissue. Larger particles, such as dust, are often captured by the eyelashes until they penetrate the lungs.</p>
<h3><span id="Exposure_to_mold_can_be_dangerous">Exposure to mold can be dangerous</span></h3>
<p>Some mold, known as mycotoxins, are products of the mold metabolism and can be toxic. Allergic reactions to fungus are usually runny nose, sneezing, red eyes, rash and symptoms usually associated with colds or hay fever. Symptoms often appear immediately, but can sometimes be delayed by hours. People with asthma can also have allergic reactions to mold. Infants, children and the elderly can suffer a lot from mold inhalation compared to healthy adults.</p>
<h3><span id="The_mold_spores_are_microscopic">The mold spores are microscopic</span></h3>
<p>Most mold spores are between 3 and 100 microns in size, but some can be as small as 1 microns. If you look at air purifiers that remove mold, it is very important to invest in a treatment that removes at least 3 microns of particles of a smaller size. HEPA air purifiers are really an excellent method to remove mold spores from the indoor air. In fact, our product experts specifically recommend HEPA air purifiers with this particular problem, and it is one of the best air purification technologies available to combat fungus, at AirPurifiers.com.</p>
<h3><span id="Mold_can_be_difficult_to_remove">Mold can be difficult to remove</span></h3>
<p>Even if you can’t completely get rid of mold in your home, it can be significantly reduced. If your house is old, the risk of mold problems is greater. Newer, watertight houses that do not allow sufficient air circulation can also be problematic. Office buildings can also often be contaminated with mold.</p>
<h3><span id="The_removal_of_mold_can_be_a_constant_process">The removal of mold can be a constant process</span></h3>
<p>Small visible areas of the fungus should be cleaned with household purifiers and also with dried areas. On the other hand, mold is often not visible because it is found in hidden places. Mold may be on a surface, but when the surface is interrupted, the spores spread through the air and begin to cause problems for individuals. Normally the spores settle over time, but when disturbed, they are absorbed in the airstream. This is where continuous operation or air purifiers form mold or can be of great help to get a clean interior.</p>
<h3><span id="Aeramax_300_Large_Room_Air_Purifier">Aeramax 300 Large Room Air Purifier</span></h3>
<p>The AeraMax 300 air purifier is suitable for large spaces. Roofs from 300 to 600 m². It is asthma and allergy characterized by the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America. Thanks to this True HEPA filter, 99.9% of these airborne particles, such as house dust mites, mold spores, cigarette smoke and other household pollen smells, are recorded.</p>

<p>The AeraMax 300 purifier contains 4 stages of purification for maximum protection against germs and allergies indoors. It is efficient and very quiet.</p>

</ul><p>Against:</p>

</ul><h3><span id="Winix_5300-2Air_Purifier_with_True_HEPA_Filter">Winix 5300-2 Air Purifier with True HEPA Filter</span></h3>
<p>This is a very popular model that uses angular construction and real HEPA filtration. In addition, it contains “PlasmaWave”, an ozone free permanent filter designed to neutralize odors, germs and pollutants in the air. It’s ideal for your office because it’s an odour-neutralising carbon filter next to a HEPA and PlasmaWave filter.</p>
<p>The air quality in the offices can vary depending on the year, the number of men and women working at the same time and the cleanliness of the space. The Smart Sensor is a great feature because it automatically evaluates the air and adjusts the fan speed accordingly. During the more muscular weeks when mold grows (i.e. in the winter when condensation occurs), the Winix 5300-2 can increase the fan speed without you having to keep an eye on it.</p>
<p>Main features :</p>
<ul><li>Genuine HEPA filtration</li>
<li>Permanent PlasmaWave filter</li>
<li>Carbon filter for smells</li>
<li>4 ventilation speeds such as “turbo” for cases where the air is particularly stale or dusty</li>

</ul><h3><span id="AllerAir_AirMedic_Pro_5_MG">AllerAir AirMedic Pro 5 MG</span></h3>
<p>This is a pretty expensive model (about $700), but in an inhabited office it’s worth it. It occupies a lot of space (about 1500 square meters) making it ideal for open plan offices. The filters are of superior quality and are therefore designed to purify the air from allergens, chemicals and smells, including smells and mold-related particles.</p>
<p>Main features :</p>
<ul><li>Genuine medical HEPA filter of medical quality</li>
<li>Active carbon filter for mold smells</li>
<li>Has wheels for easy mobility in the office in different regions</li>
<li>3 ventilation speeds for airflow control</li>

<p>If you are on the market for the <strong>best air purifier for mold</strong>, this is a really good place to start. Produced by Coway, this purifier has everything you need to get rid of mold. Firstly, the filtration system is excellent. It has a certified HEPA filter, but it also has an odour filter, a pre-filter (which can be cleaned) and an ioniser, which will remove even more contaminants from the air. In fact, this purifier can remove up to 99.97% of airborne particles larger than 0.3 microns. This high percentage, together with the amount of filters that can make the mold marks work, will provide you with an excellent opportunity to get rid of them as quickly as possible. This device can also be used at different levels of speed, so you can adapt it to your needs. What is impressive, however, is the simple fact that this unit, even at the highest speed, can be silent. The only problem with this purifier is that it is a relatively short range, although it will also help you to keep the big effects focused in terms of mold care. Really, it’s a good room air purifier you should check out.</p>
<p>PROS :</p>
<ul><li>Very quiet</li>
<li>Long Warranty</li>
<li>Complex filtration system to remove as many contaminants as possible</li>
<li>Multiple speed quantities</li>
</ul><p>CONS :</p>
<ul><li>The coverage area can be small for some rooms</li>
</ul><p>So there it is! If all goes well, you’ll feel more ready to go outside and get the best air purifier for the mold you’re able to pick up your hands. Make sure you find one that uses a real HEPA filter, can handle the place where you plan to use it, is not too noisy and comes with a good warranty. If you find the ideal unit for your needs, this mold will probably be gone!</p>
<p>You certainly don’t have to spend your arm and leg to get an air purifier that can help control airborne mold. In fact, some of the larger models on this list are now quite affordable. Provided you have a real HEPA filter (or at least one HEPA filter), an active carbon filter and an alternative fan speed, you’re on the right track.</p>
<p>If you’re wondering which model to choose, I’d say the PureZone 3-in-1 True HEPA air purifier is your best choice. It is affordable, attractive and contains the filtration we want and need for mold problems; true HEPA filtration, activated carbon filter and UV-C light. This may be for smaller rooms, but it’s so affordable that you can take 2 and put one in the bedroom and one in the living room when you’re ready.</p>
<h2><span id="Prevention_Of_Mold_And_Mildew">Prevention Of Mold And Mildew</span></h2>
<p>Killing mold with your air purifier is a good prevention. To increase the effectiveness of mold and mildew prevention, you can count on the following activities.</p>
<p>Repair of leaks: Leaking pipes or roof systems can increase the humidity in your home and create an ideal environment for mold formation. Repair dry areas and clear wet areas immediately.</p>
<p>Cleaning after the flood: Don’t just leave your cellar under water, as it’s a huge source of moisture for mold growth. Post-flood cleaning is essential to keep your cellar dry.</p>
<p>Check the air outlet: The kitchen and bathroom are the most likely places for mold growth. Make sure that the air vent works as well as possible to remove moisture from the outside of the house.</p>
<p>And last but not least, you should pick up your best <strong>mold air purifier</strong> in 2019. Thanks for reading!</p>
