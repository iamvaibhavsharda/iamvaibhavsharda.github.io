							<p>Coway is an innovative South Korean company that produces products to help purify the home. They create a lot of water and air cleaners. And in cities like Seoul and Hong Kong, air purifiers are required.</p>

<p>Coway’s old model <strong>Coway AP-1512HH</strong> remains a complete beautiful appearance and there is still a lot of fuel in the tank in case you find the second best air purifier until 2019, but many newer Coway units are easily available.

<ul><li>The upper light cannot be switched off.</li>
<li>The ionizer emits some ozone</li>
</ul><p>The Coway AP-1512HH uses a multi-layer filter system to purify the air flowing through your device. The Coway is equipped with some of the most reliable mechanisms to ensure that the air released is clean and tidy. In addition to removing contaminants, this air purifier eliminates odors to make sure your room just has fresh, clean air.</p>
<p><strong>HEPA technology</strong> is one of the most efficient filtration techniques used by air purifiers. The Coway AP-1512HH uses the real HEPA filter system to purify the air that passes through it.</p>
<p>This highly reliable filtration system removes up to 99.97% of air pollutants. With this <strong>air purifier</strong> in your home, you can be sure that the air in every room is free of dust, pollen, mold spores, animal skin flakes, and more.</p>
<p>The AP-1512HH comes with an air detection system that determines the level of air pollution. If the system runs for half an hour without even detecting air pollutants, the system immediately stops the fan to save electricity. This wise technology ensures that the air in any room is clean and tidy and is also great for your wallet.</p>
<p>Air purifiers authorized by the AHAM certification program are authorized and confirmed by an independent laboratory, which ensures that purchasers of air cleaners can work according to the company’s claims regarding the recommended room size and minimize 3 medium sized household particles: cigarette smoke, dust and pollen, also known as the <strong>Clean Air Delivery Rate (CADR)</strong>.</p>
<p>Coway is your number one Korean manufacturer for air cleaners without a design. With 30 years in this industry, this is truly a sign for the life care industry in Korea. They also rank first in Korea for market share and brand recognition in the consumer electronics sector. A reputable brand is, of course, the very first reason that is taken into account when purchasing a product or technology. The Coway AP-1512HH, in fact, meets all of an individual’s air quality needs in their home.</p>
<h2><span id="Our_analysis_and_evaluation_results">Our analysis and evaluation results</span></h2>
<p>The <strong>Coway AP-1512HH</strong> is one of the most efficient in most categories, but the lifetime costs are around the average. It is a rare product that is both at the front of the area, which does not have to pay any premium to get this high-end performance.</p>
<h2><span id="Performance_Responses">Performance Responses</span></h2>
<p>Supported by a high-end air filter and a silent fan, the Coway AP-1512HH was the most efficient in our tests, as you can see in the table above.</p>
<p>We calculate all our scores on the basis of a number of evaluations that we divide into different test parameters. The following sections discuss how the Coway AP-1512HH performed in each of these parameters.</p>
<h2><span id="Performance_of_the_air_purifier">Performance of the air purifier</span></h2>
<p>The Coway AP-1512HH belonged to the top 4 models that scored 8 out of 10 in our air cleaning tests. Each of these models was able to remove almost 100% of the airborne particles in our living room of smoky test chamber of 360 square feet room.</p>
<h2><span id="Coway_AP-1512HH_Price">Coway AP-1512HH Price</span></h2>
<p>Like Winix – yet another South Korean manufacturer – Coway focuses on a very wide range of consumers, ranging from ordinary low-end air purifiers to high-quality high-end air purifiers. We understand very well the tendency of these South Korean producers to purify each dish with their own taste with air purifiers.</p>
<p>It’s no secret that Coway had to do something big with this air purifier, to release something to stop the progression of extra low speed air purifiers. Actually I didn’t expect the Coway AP-1512HH wouldn’t be that big. Yes, there are still some elements that prevent it from becoming the ideal air purifier, but jumping on the podium from the very beginning is really a very remarkable achievement.</p>
<p>Today, however, it has fallen significantly, with the launch of these new AIRMEGA lovers and the AIRMEGA 400S, the brand’s flagship. This makes Coway AP-1512HH stand one of the lower range air purifiers, with an attractive price of about $199. The unit is available in two colours – a dark black and a white colour. If you are trying to find a contrast, you should inspect the Honeywell HPA300 – the American manufacturer’s engine. Whether the Blueair Sense+ is also a great choice, packing with Smart features with exactly the same performance with our Coway AP-1512HH.</p>
<p>Maybe the Coway AP-1512HH is really what we deserve. Get a standard air purifier in at a very affordable price.</p>
<p>Top Coway AP-1512HH is currently working on the…</p>
<p>Coway AP-1512HH powerful air purifier with real HEPA and Eco Mode from Black Edition.</p>
<p>The #1 Amazon Hot New Release #1 for HEPA air purifiers. With a 4-stage filter system and a durable pre-filter, this air purifier can clean all contaminants in a room of 361 square meters.</p>
<h2><span id="What_are_the_costs_of_the_filters_where_can_I_get_them_and_how_often_should_they_be_replaced">What are the costs of the filters, where can I get them and how often should they be replaced?</span></h2>
<p>When you buy your air purifier, I recommend that you purchase a replacement Coway filter package for AP-1512HH. The replacement filter set is excellent because it is a bundle that comes with only two carbon pre-filters and a replacement HEPA filter. This is all you need for a whole year in one package.</p>
<p>Most air purifiers require you to buy carbon and HEPA filters and it can be expensive. The Coway replacement filter set for your AP-1512HH can be purchased in some places on the Internet, such as in the Bed bath and beyond and in the Amazon. Normally it costs about $50, which is not bad for a year of clean air.</p>
<p>You can keep your filters clean by vacuuming them with a brush for airborne pollutants in auto mode. Vacuum the micromesh filter only every fortnight, then vacuum the carbon filter and HEPA filter every month.</p>
<h2><span id="What_is_the_guarantee">What is the guarantee?</span></h2>
<p>The Coway AP-1512HH includes a 3-year warranty.</p>
<h2><span id="How_can_the_Coway_AP-1512HH_work">How can the Coway AP-1512HH work?</span></h2>
<p>Like many other air purifiers, the Coway AP-1512HH Mighty air purifier contains a carbon filter and a real HEPA filter. However, the Coway contains two extra steps that many cleaners do not have. At the front of the carbon layer there is a micronet layer and an ionizer that supports the HEPA filter.</p>
<p>The micro-network coating is made of metal and can be used to capture solid particles, dust and animal hair. This coating is not difficult to clean and extends the life of their carbon and HEPA filters. This coating can be very easy to remove, so that the dust falls into the bin.</p>

This layer holds larger particles like pollen and rabbit dust that go through the net, but the main purpose is to clean the air from odors. Activated carbon is a universal filter that is also known for eliminating odours. In fact, there are a few shoe soles that use active carbon to eliminate the smell of smelly feet.</p>
<p>The air then passes through the original HEPA filter. It is the coating that makes it possible to carry out the actual heavy lifting by filtering dust, pet hair and even smoke. The U.S. Department of Energy checks all actual HEPA filters to make sure they can filter 99.97% of the particles larger than 0.3 microns. This means that this filter is large enough to catch cigars and cigarette smoke.</p>
<p>The ionizer is the last step that the air goes through until it is blown into the room. The ionizer has a negative charge of air pollutants. These harmful particles then bind to the positively charged dust particles that float in the air, which then become too heavy and sink into the ground. With the ionizer running, you will see that there is more dust on each of the surfaces in the room. Then why do you want this?</p>
<p>Well, because the whole purpose of this Coway AP-1512HH is to purify the air! Instead of the dust that floats in the air to breathe in, it is deposited on the ground, where it can be sucked in or dusted off. The ionizer can be switched on or off in case you do not need this attribute. Many people nowadays prefer not to use ionisers because they are worried about them. Even the Coway AP-1512HH emits a very small amount of ozone as soon as the ionizer is present, but this amount is not noticeable.</p>
<h2><span id="Coway_Filters_AP-1512HH">Coway Filters AP-1512HH</span></h2>
<p>Almost perfect. This is the best way to explain the filtration power of the Coway AP-1512HH.</p>
<p>In the low-end segment, most air cleaner manufacturers have to sacrifice something – the air filter, the noise level or even the electric fan. In the Coway AP-1512HH, surprisingly enough, there is absolutely no sacrifice. To compete with Winix with its PlasmaWave technology, Coway has developed an additional air purification process that is sufficient to maintain an average level. Let’s take a look at the 4-step filtering of the Coway AP-1512HH:</p>
<ol><li>Pre-filter — A washable pre-filter can help you to capture large particles of contaminants, pet hair, body hair and mold. Don’t forget that this pre-filter is waterproof and therefore durable in use.</li>
<li>Active carbon filter — This filter does its best to capture and interrogate harmful gasoline to keep your environment fresh and odorless.</li>
<li>True HEPA Filter — The high-quality composite HEPA filter that captures 99.97% of contaminants, virus particles, pollen, fungi and parasites up to 0.3 microns.</li>
<li>Ionizer — Critical ionization promotes cleaning power and cools the air. Can be switched on/off.</li>
</ol><p>Little has changed in the energy of Coway air purifiers, but this is still considered one of the best True HEPA air purifiers in the world. To check the performance score of the Coway AP-1512HH, I used a Levoit LV-PUR131 of $199 and a Honeywell HPA600B of $699. The end result is actually amazing, as the Coway AP-1512HH and Honeywell HPA600B can capture 99.97% of the particles as small as 0.3 microns, while the Levoit LV-PUR131 offers 99.9% lower efficiency.</p>
<h3><span id="1_Pre-filter">1. Pre-filter</span></h3>
<p>No longer a common feature in today’s price-sensitive market, the durable washable or vacuumable fiberglass pre-filter does a great job of capturing larger dust particles until another filter comes into place. The filter is a big advantage with the air purifier.</p>
<p>Many manufacturers have eliminated this pre-filter to reduce costs, but Coway has left it unchanged. This filter is reliable and focused on the largest particles such as dust and animal hair. In addition, this filter extends the life of other filters in the system by simply preventing them from becoming clogged with larger particles. Finally, this filter can also be washable.</p>
<h3><span id="2_Odour_filter">2. Odour filter</span></h3>
<p>Then, in accordance with the carbon filter, which does not work as expected. These odour filtration systems, although thick, may contain less carbon and are semi-transparent when exposed to light. Although the Coway is excellent at removing dust and germs, it will not impress anyone with its odor control.</p>
<p>Odour filters are also called active carbon filters. These filters can be effective in reducing odours due to the chemical and physical structure of this carbon. Activated carbon is a very porous substance with the distinctive ability to deal with pollutants at the atomic level, which makes it possible to consume certain substances because they come into contact with the filter.</p>
<h3><span id="3_Genuine_HEPA_filter">3. Genuine HEPA filter</span></h3>
<p>An original HEPA filter completes the Coway filter range. Now that all these brands are no longer using their old product, in our opinion the supply of and access to filters is more important than the price of the filters. The AP-1512HH requires the replacement of this original HEPA filter every year and 6 weeks for the carbon filter. Surprisingly, this short replacement period offers many advantages for retailers to maintain their stock levels.</p>
<p>High efficiency soot filters will be the standard Gold niches. HEPA filters are made of an ultra-fine fibrous material that targets contaminants in microscopic quantities. They are so powerful that they are recommended by the environment for disease control to tackle germs and other toxic airborne contaminants.</p>
<p>HEPA filters target a wide range of contaminants and are particularly useful for people suffering from asthma or allergies, each of which can be activated by the particles that this filter is designed to remove.</p>
<p>A filter switch timer that lights up an indicator light when certain operating hours reach a certain point. Coway’s 1-year replacement kit, part number 3304899, contains 1 HEPA filter and 2 active carbon filters. The filter package sells for $49.99 cheaply and is available at Amazon.com (check out the latest price here).</p>
<h3><span id="Negative_ionizer">Negative ionizer</span></h3>
<p>Then comes the ionizer, it’s a simple negative ion emitter, but it’s called “Coway Vital Ion Technology”. Another switch switches the ionizer on and off. In the following paragraphs we will discuss each phase of the Coway AP-1512HH Mighty Air Purifier filtering process.</p>
<h2><span id="Coway_AP-1512HH_Coway_Design_and_size">Coway AP-1512HH Coway Design and size</span></h2>
<p>Well, it’s like Coway makes extreme changes to industrial design every year, or even wants to make many changes in a year.</p>
<p>And this is exactly the case… Coway AP-1512HH only shares the same concept and minimum level AP-0512NH. Honestly, I don’t mind at all. The Coway AP-1512HH was one of the most beautiful air purifiers ever.</p>
<p>The front and back are covered with vinyl, but the Coway AP-1512HH looks even more luxurious than the Winix 5500-2 or even the Coway AP-0512NHH. Place the Coway AP-1512HH next to an iPod and you’d be surprised if you saw the resemblance. There are many air inlets under the front plastic plate to help bring contaminated air into the air filtration process of this unit.</p>
<p>In addition, we have 5 function keys at the top of the air purifier. Like all traditional air cleaners, the Coway AP-1512HH comes with an air outlet grille to bring the brand new air to an environment.</p>
<p>Out of the box, the Coway AP-1512HH is a really great device to take a look at, with a height of 18.3 inches and a diameter of 16.8 inches. It is compact but tasteful, with a transparent feeling of superior quality when you look at it.</p>
<p>However, it doesn’t feel like the most expensive on the market – it doesn’t matter what kind of Coway pattern is provided to charge this air purifier, it doesn’t come in the plan. However, it feels like a system that can be mentioned in exactly the same breath because the Honeywell HPA300 and Blueair Sense + can be mentioned in the same breath in terms of construction quality.</p>
<p>Coway hasn’t changed the timeless layout of the Korean air purifiers with two handles on each side. However, at 12.3 pounds, this air purifier at the level with Levoit LV-PUR131 is bold and is lighter compared to many air purifiers in its own homeland, including Winix WAC9500 or Winix 5500-2. The air purifier at Levoit LV-PUR131 level is bold and is lighter compared to many air purifiers in its own state, including Winix WAC9500 or Winix 5500-2.</p>
<p>This first-class performance is enhanced especially by a Smart Smart Smart True HEPA filter, which can be made from this high quality fabric. An essential ionizer can be crucial in discharging a cloud of energetic ions to capture allergens hidden around the actual HEPA filter. This air purification system is exactly what makes Rabbit Air BioGS 2.0 so effective, and again it benefits the Coway AP-1512HH in another level of air filtration.</p>

<p>As if cleaning the upper recess wasn’t enough, the Coway was also the quietest operator among our test models. He scored a 9 out of 10 in an evaluation that was dozens of times lower than the 4th place.</p>
<p>If the setting is high, the laoway produces an average-high spinning It’s a bit loud, but somehow the pitch tends to fade in the background, and we didn’t think it would interrupt audio pleasures like listening to the radio or watching the TV. If you use it in your bedroom, it can actually be twice as effective as a beautiful white noise machine. Other models that seemed equally innocent in their own high configurations were the Blueair Pure 211 and the Levoit LV-PUR131.</p>
<p>The Coway fan has a Big Deal of Energy, but produces a sound that is soft enough not to disturb your Netflix binge viewing session.</p>
<p>Pull the Coway down to moderate the pitch pawls and lower the volume. This deep spinning is almost silent, but it’s still clear. It’s like the quiet buzz that keeps coming out of a fridge. If you click on it to reduce the size of the Coway, the Coway is almost silent. You’ll probably forget it’s on, even if you sit still and read only one novel.</p>
<p>For review, an air cleaner designed for the bedroom, Coway AP-1512HH must meet the strict requirements to not be noisy. Many bedroom centred air purifiers take full advantage of the Coway AP-1512HH to produce a terrible white sound, a soothing ambient sound to help people fall asleep. You must carefully choose an air purifier in your bedroom, otherwise you will be kept awake continuously at night.</p>
<p>The Coway AP-1512HH has only 3 fan speeds, with a background noise level of 24.4 decibels. It’s just the sound level of that whisper, even in real life you hardly have the ability to listen to anything. Even at its highest setting at 54 decibels (db), the Coway AP-1512HH produces fantastic white noise with a calming noise from the fan. That is why Coway AP-1512HH is currently the best bedroom air purifier in 2019.</p>
<h2><span id="How_do_I_use_the_Coway_AP-1512HH">How do I use the Coway AP-1512HH?</span></h2>
<p>The Coway AP-1512HH powerful air purifier includes 5 speed settings, 3 speed settings, automatic mode and eco mode. Like many air purifiers, it is low, moderate and has high speeds. The minimum speed is almost silent and is ideal for watching movies, studying or sleeping. Medium looks like a low white noise. Some people may like to sleep and use it all day long. High looks like a fan that rotates high and pushes enough air to make you feel like you’re putting your hands in front of a window. The ionizer can be used at almost any speed or in car and eco modes.</p>
<p>The automatic and green modes work essentially the same way, and they are very intelligent. In automatic mode, the Coway AP-1512HH corrects the fan speed according to the level of air pollution. There is a small sensor on the front of the machine under a lid. You can clean the detector with a cotton swab about once every two weeks to make sure it remains accurate. If the unit is in automatic mode, if it finds clean air for 30 minutes, it switches to eco mode and switches off before the air is polluted again.</p>
<p>This can be a very useful function for men and women who just want to place it and forget about it. In automatic mode, you can save a lot of energy and don’t have to worry about your preferences.</p>
<p>But how can the sensor be true? In automatic mode, it lights up when you blow out a nearby candle. That’s pretty impressive! The only disadvantage of automatic mode is when it detects air pollution and lights up when you don’t need it, for reviewple when you are watching a movie.</p>
<p>At the top of the unit there is a light that tells you how dirty the air is. If the light is blue, the air is clean; if it is purple, the air is moderately dirty; and if the light is red, the air is really dirty. This is a great way to really see the Coway AP-1512HH purify the air in your home as the color changes from red to purple to blue.</p>
<p>The Coway AP-1512HH also has a timer so you can use it for a specified time and it switches off automatically. The timer can be set to 1, 4 or 8 hours. This is very good for those who just want to drive their air purifier when they are at work or asleep. Plus, it’s great if you want to clean part of your house fast. Let’s say you burned a chicken on your kitchen – no problem, just connect it to the Coway and put it on top for an hour.</p>
<p>The Coway has a clear and simple interface. Many buttons on the top of the unit allow you to set the fan speed, turn the ionizer on and off and set a 1, 4 or 8 hour timer. Fan settings are low, moderate, high and environmentally friendly. In addition, it includes an integrated air quality meter, which means that it is possible to set the fan speed on car and allow the purifier to increase and decrease the surrounding air quality controllers.</p>
<p>We have discovered that, with good air quality, this job is the most accurate of all the jobs we have chosen. While other models with integrated air quality meters did not respond regularly to the increase in air pollutants, Coway continuously improved its fan speed when our outdoor air quality meter showed an increase in particulate matter in the air. At 12.7 lbs, the Coway isn’t particularly light, but it’s the thin carrying handles that make it pretty easy to manoeuvre.</p>
<p>One important feature of the AP-1512HH is that it pulls the air in at the front and bottom and upwards. This is great because you don’t have to worry too much about where you put it. As long as there’s room in the front and it’s visible upstairs, it should be good. I prefer air cleaners that blow the air upwards; this way it doesn’t blow newspapers everywhere with even clean air that can flow gently from the ceiling downwards.</p>
<p>There are only two lights and also a button on this machine. These are indicator lights to inform you whether both filters need to be replaced. Simply change the charcoal filter every six weeks and the HEPA filter every six weeks. If you are at the top when cleaning and vacuuming your own filters, in addition to washing your own micronet filter, you can keep making these filters much longer.</p>
<h2><span id="Coway_AP-1512HH_AP-1512HH_Electricity_consumption">Coway AP-1512HH AP-1512HH Electricity consumption</span></h2>
<p>One of the most frequently asked questions is: “Do air purifiers use a lot of energy?”. In fact, the air purifier has to be used for a very long time to be more effective. And electricity consumption is just one of the important criteria for determining how much energy this air purifier will consume.</p>
<p>Get ready to be surprised, because the Coway AP-1512HH can already consume 4.9 watts of power thanks to this fantastic eco mode. This eco mode puts the air cleaner on standby (which consumes only 4.9 g) if it finds better air quality and there is absolutely no need to run the fan. It is safe to say that Coway AP-1512HH has become by far the most energy efficient air purifier in today’s industry. The absolute novelty in terms of energy saving: the rabbit’s air can simply reach a minimum of 5 grams.</p>
<p>The Coway AP-1512HH model fan differs from conventional air cleaning fans that make noise when you turn them on. The Coway has a quiet operation and runs smoothly in almost every corner of the apartment. With the high efficiency of the air purifier, you may wonder what the various side effects of the gadget are. You can be sure that you have no problems using this air purifier and that everyone in your home can operate it easily.</p>
<p>In addition to the simplicity of operation, this air purifier offers many environmentally friendly functions. As indicated on this light sensor model, the fan switches on or off automatically, depending on the pollutants in the ambient air. This invention not only saves on your energy bill, but also increases the number of people looking for environmentally friendly practices that can support the environment.</p>
<p>The particle detection system is in fact a powerful method for keeping all types of microbial progress outdoors. The system keeps you healthy and eliminates all kinds of unpleasant odours.</p>

The Coway AP 1512HH is not only an alternative, but a perfect answer to the problems faced by many people. It has been described by many users since the lowest energy-consuming air purifier on the market.</p>
<p>With only 15.6 watts of operation at the lowest fan speed, you can be sure that this air purifier will go a very long way to reduce your energy bill. To visualize the electricity consumption, the 15.6 Watt consumption is converted to 2.1 Watt more than what incandescent lamps normally consume.</p>
<p>The Coway was really one of the most efficient models in our tests, with a consumption of only 0.01 kWh of power per hour of performance. This varies up to about $5.26 a year in many homes. However, the replacement filters are a bit expensive and we usually find them for $60, although there are sometimes cheaper alternatives.</p>
<p>The best replacement packaging is a single HEPA filter and 2 charcoal filters, which, according to the manufacturer’s recommendations, may be sufficient to last a year. The list price of $230 can also be slightly above average, which means you have to pay a little more in advance.</p>
<p>But if you continue to use this Coway AP-1512HH with the highest ventilation speed, the power consumption can be up to 78 watts. To date, the Winix WAC9500 consumes about 70 watts and the Honeywell HPA300 also increases to 130 watts. The Coway AP-1512HH may not be the best energy saver, but it is not the worst.</p>
<p>Let’s think, for only 8 hours of use per afternoon, it usually costs you 10 to 30 dollars a year. Yeah, that’s exactly how you pay for a light bulb every year.</p>
<h2><span id="Safety_and_certification">Safety and certification</span></h2>
<p>With the 4-stage air filter system, the Coway AP-1512HH can purify the air in your room. But in the previous filtration measurement, “Vital Ion” ionizes the air molecules. The fees are then transferred to the pollutant particles to make it easier to remove these loaded particles during another air purification cycle. A very small percentage of ionised air has a variable effect on ozone formation, which can cause problems in very sensitive and debilitating lungs.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Coway has unveiled and obtained the California Air Resource Board (CARB) certification to prove that the air purifier generates less than 0.05 ppm of pumped molecules. Therefore, Coway AP-1512HH Coway is unlikely to cause respiratory problems. In addition, if you are really worried about this issue, you can turn off the “Vital Ion” ionizer.</p>
<p>A fantastic part of the Coway air purifier would be the energy consumption. Most large air purifiers use more than 60W in the cheapest mode, but the Coway uses only 5W. In fact, it is accredited by “Energy Star” for its very low energy consumption. This air purifier has no significant effect on your electrical charge, even if it is used 24 hours a day.</p>
<h2><span id="Advantages_and_disadvantages">Advantages and disadvantages</span></h2>
<h3><span id="Advantages">Advantages</span></h3>
<p>The Coway AP 1512HH is very efficient, with a CADR value of 210 for dust and particle cleaning, what better device would you receive for this price range? The air purifier contains at least a 4-stage air filter system that removes all kinds of dust and odours from your home.</p>
<p>From an air quality signal to a system that stops when the air purification is complete, the Coway is definitely designed to extract purifying air in a child’s play. It is not surprising that many users of the Coway AP 1512HH recently charge the latest Coway AP 1512HH with world-class work for air cleaners. This air purifier also has a celebrity who is “energy efficient” and most of its features are designed to ensure that you can cover the lowest potential energy bill.</p>
<h3><span id="Disadvantages">Disadvantages</span></h3>
<p>You will find different ratings when it comes to how noisy Coway AP-1512HH Mighty Air Purifier is. When the fan is running at high speed, it is often very noisy, but when it is running at low speed, it is quite quiet and you hardly hear it. There are many good things about this particular device, but one of the negative aspects is that it does not completely eliminate odors or chemical compounds from the air.</p>
<p>Moreover, the air quality indicator is often unreliable. The air purifier is very likely to increase the room temperature, which causes some kind of dent in the operation of the air purifier, in order to save energy in your home. The Coway AP-1512HH manages to reduce efficiency in large areas. The very important ionic component is not recommended for people with sensitive respiratory problems.</p>
<h2><span id="How_does_it_relate_to_each_other">How does it relate to each other?</span></h2>
<p>Coway AP-1512HH vs. AP-1012GH</p>
<p>These two models are similar in many ways. The two 4-stage filtration systems that use an ionizer both have a timer and an automatic mode to detect and react to air pollution. However, they differ in crucial places. The Coway AP-1012GH contains a HEPA filter that lasts three decades, while the AP-1512HH only lasts one year.</p>
<p>This makes the AP-1012GH easier for your set-it-and-forget-it types. Another difference is the amount of space for which each of them is assessed. The Coway AP-1512HH is valued at 528 square feet, while the AP-1012GH is valued at 355 square feet.</p>
<h3><span id="Coway_AP-1512HH_vs_rabbit_air">Coway AP-1512HH vs. rabbit air</span></h3>
<p>The Coway AP-1512HH and Rabbit Air BioGS 2.0 have very similar filtration systems. Both have four-phase filtration systems that use a microgrid, activated carbon, HEPA filter and ionizer. One of the most important differences is that Rabbit Air has a more powerful active carbon filter.</p>
<p>This thicker filter should remove unpleasant odours better. Another difference is the price. The Rabbit Air costs about $150 more than the Coway. Filters are slightly more expensive, but they often have to be cleaned.</p>
<h3><span id="Coway_AP-1512HH_vs_Winix_5500">Coway AP-1512HH vs. Winix 5500</span></h3>
<p>The Winix 5500 has only one filter that is smaller than the Coway. With the Coway you get a micro-network that protects the filters from large particles, while the Winix does not use the micro-network. On the other hand, Winix states that it is sufficient to replace the HEPA filter every 3 decades. They also claim that the HEPA filter is washable, but that washing can significantly reduce efficiency. I recommend that you wash it once or twice during the life of this filter.</p>
<p>The Winix can be built for smaller distances in 360 square meters instead of 528 square meters on the Coway. 1 thing that people seem to want about Winix is that it contains a remote control that you can use to change the fan speed and other configurations.</p>
<h3><span id="Coway_AP-1512HH_vs_Germguardian_AC4825">Coway AP-1512HH vs. Germguardian AC4825</span></h3>
<p>GermGuardian uses a slightly different process than Coway’s to filter the air. Unlike Coway, GermGuardian doesn’t use an ionizer. The GermGuardian has an exaggerated measure that the Coway doesn’t have. After charcoal and HEPA filters, GermGuardian uses UV light to destroy all kinds of viruses and germs. This is very good for people who are worried not only about allergies, but also about other diseases.</p>
<p>However, the Coway beats the GermGuardian on the dimensions of the room, which is rated only for 155 square meters. Coway also contains some attributes that GermGuardian does not have, such as the automatic mode that adjusts the cleaning energy based on air pollution.</p>
<h2><span id="Do_I_have_to_buy_the_Coway_AP-1512HH">Do I have to buy the Coway AP-1512HH?</span></h2>
<p>Yeah, no doubt about it. The Coway AP-1512HH is your best budget air purifier you can get now. This air purifier features a high quality and powerful air filtration process, an accurate intelligent sensor and quiet operation to serve you anywhere in your home.</p>
<ol><li>In case of serious allergies or allergies to air pollutants: the Coway AP-1512HH is good with the True HEPA filter and its own 4-stage air purification system.</li>
<li>If you want more performance or ventilation capacity to clean your room faster: it’s possible to look for the Honeywell HPA300 and Blue Pure 211 with a CADR value above 300 cfm.</li>
<li>If you want an air purifier with much better space protection: that the Alen Paralda and Alen T500 are much better at 500 square meters, you can also buy the Blue Pure 211 to easily pay for your 540 square meters room.</li>
<li>If you need an economic edition of the air purifier: it is possible to search for the Coway AP-0512NH or Honeywell HPA100. I have evaluated a reduced price development for your Winix 5300-2, Winix 5500-2 and Winix C535, so you shouldn’t turn down this opportunity either.</li>
<li>If you want a quieter air purifier: that the Coway AP-1512HH is really quiet for the price.</li>
<li>If you are really worried about the annual cost of the filter and the cost of energy: that the Coway AP-1512HH is one of the very economic choices for you.</li>
<li>If you like the extra features: You can choose between the GermGuardian CDAP5500BCA, Honeywell HPA250B and Blueair Sense+ for Smart Wifi connectivity and Smart Sensor features.</li>
