<p>A compact model with relatively poor performance without replacement functions to compensate for this.</p>
<p>The biggest question is: how healthy is this Hamilton Beach air purifier for your air? Clean air is vital for the health of asthma and allergy sufferers. I will not give you all the subtleties of the impact of allergens on asthma sufferers, as you no doubt already know. In fact, that’s probably why you’re here.</p>
<p>You already understand that coughing, whining, tight lungs and coughing are symptoms of inhaling polluted air (which can be embarrassing for all concerned).</p>
<p>Let’s get into the good stuff – the nitty-gritty of an air purifier by Hamilton Beach – the TrueAir Allergen-Reducing Air Purifier 04383A.</p>
<p>Hamilton Beach Appliances has been active since 1910 and offers a wide range of products. You may be more familiar with their many devices and food producers (ice cream, popcorn, bread, pasta…I get lost). They have excellent air-purifying gadgets, such as the Hamilton Beach True Air Odor Eliminator fragrance cleaner with pilot light.</p>
<p>If you’re tall in air cleaners and filtration (I mean, it’s not?) you’re aware of TrueAir, under Hamilton Beach documented brands. Under this brand they sell air cleaners, deodorizers and extra parts and filters.</p>
<p>But back in the 04383 air purifier. There is much to discuss with this particular creature that purifies the air, because in addition to a number of intriguing consumer comments, there are a number of other interesting features…..to consider.</p>
<h2><span id="Our_analysis_and_evaluation_results">Our analysis and evaluation results</span></h2>
<p>The Hamilton Beach TrueAir is a bad performer and costs more than other compact models in the very long run, making it a bad choice for the majority of users.</p>
<h2><span id="Performance_Comparison">Performance Comparison</span></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>As you can see in the table above, the Hamilton Beach TrueAir was the worst public awareness of our tests. For more information on why he got such a low score, read the paragraphs below. In all our unique evaluations, we go into detail about the results achieved.</p>
<p>The general evaluation of Hamilton Beach TrueAir 04383 is largely based on the way the model eliminated dust and smoke from a test area, as well as the noise level of the air purifiers.</p>
<p>Dust, pollen and smoke removal: Because mannequins remove fine clay and cigarette smoke from the air, the performance of laptops is at its highest and lowest speed. Those who felt good about dust removal should have a comparable pollen yield.</p>
<p>Noise: Based on tool measurement using a portable model that operates at the highest and lowest speeds.</p>
<h2><span id="Performance_of_the_air_purifier">Performance of the air purifier</span></h2>
<p>Hamilton Beach TrueAir was one of the worst players in our air cleaning tests, sharing the barrel base with an extra model. We place it for one hour in our smoke-filled test chamber and it reduces the concentration of airborne particles by 89.49%. By comparison, the most efficient compact model (GermGuardian AC4100) achieved a 95.32% drop, and most full-size models managed to break 99%. That’s why TrueAir will make the air purifier, but you can also find other similar models that can do much better. Moreover, it is the only model we examined that does not define a CADR (Clean Air Delivery Rate), but we also assume that it would be about 60 or even 70, which means that it is powerful enough for spaces under 100 square meters.</p>
<p>In our compact conflict cleaners, the Hamilton Beach TrueAir was in the back of the backpack, hampered by poor air cleaning performance, fragile controls and expensive filters. If you are looking for a compact cleaner for a small space, we recommend the GermGuardian AC4100. It is more effective in cleaning the air and is cheaper in the long run.</p>
<p>Relatively poor area for Hamilton Beach TrueAir 04384, which is only suitable for a small room. Again, no official statistics have been published for Hamilton Beach TrueAir 04384 CADR, but our internal evaluation shows that it performs below average, which is not surprising since this air purifier, which really reduces allergens, is designed for.</p>
<h2><span id="CADR">CADR</span></h2>
<p>The manufacturer explains nothing about CADR, but I discovered it on CADR Online Quotes from 40-50. All this is estimated because the filtration system is not good enough to produce dimensions for small particles and therefore probably does not qualify for CADR. If we then take the CADR 50, with the recommended room size of 160 square feet and a ceiling height of 8 feet, the device produces 1280 cubic feet per second. 1280/50 = 25 minutes. I think a complete change of air in the room twice in an hour is very bad.</p>
<p>The powerful HEPA filter system captures air particles from 3 microns. It will also make the air 99p. 100 cleaner than for use. This device is usually designed to remove odors and scales from pets, but it has also been proven to remove specific allergens from the air.</p>

<h2><span id="Noise">Noise</span></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>The sound produced by this TrueAir during our tests was relatively low, giving it a higher score than the average of 7 out of 10. The TrueAir is one of the most common sound-generating devices in the world. In height, it produces a very low hum that will probably disappear into the background after a few minutes of jogging, but is still a bit more striking than that of Coway. At a moderate level, this humming is quieter but still perceptible. At reduced, buzzing is very quiet and barely perceptible, much rest before reading or meditating.</p>
<p>The two things that people are looking for when you buy an air purifier are now the main features of this device. No one wants a noisy air purifier that can distract you from your daily tasks, which is why the Hamilton Beach Cleaner is specially designed to be very quiet when cleaning the air and has a compact design that you can install almost anywhere. Having a large and strong cleaner is never good, especially since you are limited in the space in which it can be placed.</p>

The central setting is also quiet and can be used during sleep. The highest setting is not very noisy but disturbs your sleep. Overall, I can really say that the noise is not annoying.</p>
<p>Comes in a modern white ABS plastic case, Hamilton Beach TrueAir 04384 is well built even if it won’t hit you like a superior outdoor air purifier. In a very small and light enclosure, Hamilton Beach TrueAir 04384, thanks to its flexible design, can be placed vertically or horizontally, depending on the distance you need, you can place it from the table, cabinet, shelf or perhaps even the floor with maximum airflow efficiency. On the top and front flaps there is a manual adjustment knob, which can be removed from the outside to clean the permanent HEPA filter.</p>
<h2><span id="Ease_of_use">Ease of use</span></h2>
<p>The Hamilton Beach TrueAir rating of 4 out of 10 was the lowest of all the tests performed as part of our usability test. It has only three fan speeds with no shutdown timer, which limits its configurability and increases the risk of you accidentally leaving it on all day while in the office. What’s more, the unique rotary knob he uses because of its control panel looks soft and inexpensive, as it can break if you’re not soft with it. In the plus column it weighs only 4.9 pounds, so it is very easy to move.</p>
<p>As the name suggests, this cleaner focuses mainly on allergens and allergy-related air problems.</p>
<p>TrueAir includes a three-stage filtration process:</p>
<p>1) A pre-filter, to capture larger particles such as hair and dust.</p>
<p>(2) Two charcoal filters, which treat light odours (such as ‘odour trap’ and ‘wet dog smell’).</p>
<ol start="3"><li>A HEPA filter designed to collect smaller particles up to 0.3 microns.</li>
</ol><p>According to the manufacturer, this device has an area of approximately 140 square meters, or a space of approximately 12 feet x 12 feet. As we say in many of our air purification reviews, the producer tends to quote on the high side. In such cases, I think that this amount is a little generous and should be lower; TrueAir is really designed to do better in small bedrooms (90 — 120 square feet; or about a 10′ x 10′ room).</p>
<p>As you can understand, air purifiers are sometimes difficult to install, especially when you are dealing with an air filter replacement. As if by chance, this device has been designed to be very user-friendly and doesn’t take a lot of time to set up. If you take it out of the box, it will be ready for use in a few minutes. After the first two days of use, we recommend vacuuming your filter. Then every 3 to 6 weeks.</p>
<p>In small bedrooms the unit works almost as well as you would expect from a cheap air purifier. It satisfactorily reduces dust levels, and you’ll probably notice a difference in the total amount of animal hair on your own floor – although TrueAir certainly leaves some support (TrueAir isn’t powerful enough to get everything, and your prefilter won’t be high enough).</p>
<p>(Note: I was a bit surprised that this device was a fake HEPA air purifier; however, not all HEPA filters are made equal, and this device is no exception – it’s just not that powerful.)</p>
<p>When it comes to scents, TrueAir will alleviate some common pet scents – but it will leave many supportive scents behind; it does almost nothing when it comes to chemical scents or cigarette smoke (to be expected – you need powerful charcoal filters to handle stubborn odours, and TrueAir charcoal filters are quite light).</p>
<p>Hamilton Beach 04383A is a very small air purifier. It looks like a speaker in white or black.</p>

<p>The dimensions are:</p>
<p>Depth 8.5 in / 21.5 cm</p>
<p>Width 6″ / 15 cm</p>
<p>Height 13,5 in / 34cm</p>
<p>The best place for this is somewhere on a shelf or table. For the user’s convenience, this device can be placed horizontally and vertically.</p>
<p>It won’t break your board because its weight is only 2.6 kg (5.7 lbs).</p>
<h2><span id="Operating_costs">Operating costs</span></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Even with a very low purchase price of 80 dollars for the device, the Hamilton Beach TrueAir is surprisingly expensive in the long run. The estimated lifetime cost is $573, which is higher than that of the Coway, as well as that of the GermGuardian AC4825, which is each much more powerful and efficient. These high costs are mainly due to the short life of the filters, which operate at $22 and need to be replaced every 90 days. These costs are easily incurred if you use this TrueAir frequently. In addition, it consumes more than average electricity, representing an estimated annual electricity cost of 10.51 dollars.</p>
<p>Hamilton Beach TrueAir Compact Pet 04384 is the most expensive unit in its own compact TrueAir range, although we find it hardly expensive. Not only does the air purifier have an attractive price advantage, but there are also very few annual maintenance costs for maintaining the filter on its own double carbon filters. Hamilton Beach TrueAir Compact Pet 04384 is perhaps not the best air purifier for pets on the market today, it can do its job provided the price of its own in.</p>

<p>The best thing about the filter and this product is that you just don’t have to buy and change the filter inside all the time. This is the biggest problem other purifiers have, you have to change their filters every month to get clean air, and of course these replaceable filters are very expensive. But this is not true with this product, it is easy to vacuum it every 3-6 weeks and it will be like new. After vacuuming, the filter will probably be fully cleaned and you can start using the cleaner without having to spend money on expensive replaceable filters. This filter does not need to be replaced if you clean it regularly.</p>

<h2><span id="It8217s_worth_it">It’s worth it.</span></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Hamilton Beach TrueAir’s $80 fixed price is the best of its kind for a compact cleaner. If you take into account your own operating costs, it becomes more expensive than many of the most efficient models in the entire range. Now buying a full-size model could have a much better value. If you prefer a compact model, the GermGuardian AC4100 is much cheaper.</p>
<p>The HEPA filter is considered to be one of the best purifying air filters, capable of capturing 99% of the parasites and particles floating in the air with a size of 3 microns. With this filter, your own ambient air is purified very quickly. In addition, unlike other cleaners, this filter can capture microparticles of animal skin scales, mould spores and, above all, pollen.</p>
<p>The manufacturer says that you don’t need to change a filter, but that you should clean it every 3-6 months. Because there is no pre-filter, a filter can be very dirty very quickly. To make cleaning easier, I suggest you clean it regularly. Opening the front panel is very easy by simply pressing the button.</p>
<h2><span id="Powerful_performance">Powerful performance</span></h2>
<p>A very important thing with the cleaners you need to look outside of Pour is their power. There are different types of air purifiers, but none of them is as effective as Hamilton Beach. This product can cover moderate spaces of approximately 160 square metres. Fantastic for bedrooms or living rooms.</p>
<h2><span id="Our_opinion">Our opinion</span></h2>
<p>In our compact conflict cleaners, the Hamilton Beach TrueAir was in the back of the backpack, hampered by poor air cleaning performance, fragile controls and expensive filters. If you are looking for a compact cleaner for a small space, we recommend the GermGuardian AC4100. It is more effective in cleaning the air and is cheaper in the long run.</p>
<p>You get what you pay for: a pretty good air purifier, nothing more and nothing less. You don’t get real HEPA filtration or odour removal. However, you get a fairly powerful dust removal, cleaner air and less sniffing and sneezing.</p>
<p>The Hamilton Beach TrueAir Compact Pet Air Purifier is cheap, but very limited. The device is sufficient to reduce light allergens and pet-related odours and is intended for use in small bedrooms only.</p>
<p>The Hamilton Beach TrueAir Compact Pet Air Purifier is cheap, but very limited. The device is sufficient to reduce light allergens and light odours associated with pets and is intended for use in small bedrooms only. True Air weakens when it comes to much more critical purification responsibilities; this device is not designed to treat strong odors or allergens, and is ineffective in moderate to massive spaces.</p>
<p>Hamilton Beach TrueAir 04384 air purifier is ideal for a person without pets who only needs a small purifying blanket. It can be placed next to a bed or in an office and can filter common contaminants, mainly dust, with minimal maintenance. If you don’t meet the compromise of airflow at a very affordable price, this simple air purifier can be the ideal alternative for you.</p>
<p>The Hamilton Beach Beach Beach TrueAir Compact Pet air purifier is a large Little model that is able to keep pet smells and fleas at bay. Although it is not designed to help people with seasonal allergies, it seems that it will be useful for some of them.</p>
<p>Since the HEPA filter never needs to be replaced and will remove up to 99% of the contaminants in an area of 140 square meters, the price of less than $50 is worth it.</p>
<p>Hamilton Beach 04383A is a trendy, compact and cheap good air purifier for small spaces. And it really works, but not for everyone. Before purchasing this device, be sure to know which function you need it for.</p>
<p>True Air weakens when it comes to more serious purification responsibilities; this device is not designed to treat strong odors or allergens and is not effective in moderate to massive spaces.</p>
<h2><span id="Frequently_asked_questions">Frequently asked questions</span></h2>
<h3><span id="What8217s_intriguing_about_the_Hamilton_Beach_TrueAir_air_purifier">What’s intriguing about the Hamilton Beach TrueAir air purifier?</span></h3>
<p>The first thing I noticed when I examined this small number were the dimensions (so small) and the requirements for replacing the filters (not a single one). Promotional photos of the air purifier show that it stands comfortably on a small shelf and doesn’t look bigger than a small stereo system.</p>
<p>The next thing that made me scratch and frown on my head is the HEPA filter. As a consumer, take note of everything that is advised to you, contrary to the truth, so let us clarify this point. Yes, the filter is of HEPA quality, but this is not true HEPA. A true HEPA filter captures particles up to 0.3 microns, but the filter in this model captures particles up to 3 microns. This usually means that the filter is designed with a HEPA dust and construction, but that the filter does not work at exactly the same level as the actual filter.</p>
<p>I’m not saying Hamilton Beach is meant to deceive you or to allude to you. But many companies use the “HEPA business card” to offer the concept that their product contains a real HEPA filter. When you read the specifications to get a quick purchase, it is very easy to think “big, HEPA filtration” if this is not quite the situation.</p>
<h3><span id="Does_it_reduce_dust_and_remove_odors_from_pets_or_diapers">Does it reduce dust and remove odors from pets or diapers?</span></h3>
<p>Due to the many reactions of customers to Amazon to get an overview of the adventures of others, some clear trends appear.</p>
<p>Yes, for most people this air purifier will not remove much dust from the air. A large number of studies show that the air is considerably cleaner and consumes much less dust. Many critics have guessed it based on the simple fact that they breathe easier and snort less.</p>

It is not a good sign if you have very fine cats and dogs that leave little clouds of down behind because they wander through the house.</p>
<p>This air purifier does not necessarily claim to capture particles as large as a pet’s hair, but it is something that many pet owners expect and seek. I advised you to look further and find an air purifier who likes to slide animal hair into your lungs until it gets into your lungs and gets stuck in your clothes.</p>
<p>What about the smells? It eliminates odors at a moderate level, but not too remarkably. Further on I have a conversation about how many users use a charcoal filter when using this air purifier. This is because it tends to remove odours more effectively than the HEPA quality filter.</p>
<p>The take-away dish? Yeah, it’ll reduce the dust. He doesn’t do much work with animal hair. It reduces the odors somewhat, but perhaps not to a high level.</p>
<h3><span id="Does_this_machine_comes_with_an_ionizer">Does this machine comes with an ionizer?</span></h3>
<p>No, it doesn’t have an ionizer, it uses HEPA quality filtration as a crucial purification technology.</p>
<p>If you are placed in an air purifier with an ionizer, reconsider this requirement. Ionizers do not have as much value and are not even as healthy as they are designed to be. Yeah, they hit the air particles and prevent them from “floating”. However, these particles eventually remain stuck on the surface of your home. For your healthiest and cleanest air, an air purifier with a genuine HEPA filter is recommended.</p>
<p>Hamilton Beach 04383 will probably not offer you the purest air in the world, but it can do a good to very good job.</p>
<h2><span id="What_do_customers_and_critics_say">What do customers and critics say?</span></h2>
<p>Oh yes, the labyrinth of emotion and exclamation marks This is the segment of customer reviews on Amazon. It’s an extreme place, but very bright. Comments with this air purifier are really a mixed bag – lots of bright, and also a bit completely dull. To put this into perspective, 13% of the exams fall into the 1-star and 2-star categories, and 79% of these exams fall into the 4-star and 5-star categories.</p>
<p>Here are some of the most common pros and cons of Joyful and n0t-so-happy customers:</p>
<h3><span id="Favorable">Favorable:</span></h3>
<p>The silence of this Hamilton Beach allergen Reducing Air Cleaner has been praised many times by favorable critics. The very first speed setting (clean whisper) is what most men and women use 24 hours a day, 7 days a week as standard mode. The moderate and fast cleaning modes are a bit noisier. All you have to do is use them for air purification, so the slightly louder sound isn’t a problem.</p>
<p>This step is a little controversial. Many tests have shown that they have fully noticed an improvement in allergy symptoms (i.e. they no longer wake up with a blocked and sniffed nose). They have noticed that the dust in their home has clearly decreased and feel that the air is cleaner and fresher.</p>
<p>The reason I’m saying it’s controversial is that a small percentage of the tests have reported the opposite…. Well… the opposite. We will discuss this again in the “negative” section. I think that this is a good indication that the vast majority of people are satisfied with the dust purification techniques. Perhaps even enough to ignore the negative comments in this region.</p>
<p>The price is a “pro” favourite because it is very low compared to some additional, more advanced air purifiers that offer the same properties. It’s pretty cheap for people with smaller budgets who can’t afford a real HEPA option. In case you have a dusty office or need to maintain a specific space in your slightly cleaner house, it is quite cheap to pick up without a large budget.</p>
<p>Ease of use and compact dimensions are a recurring theme in the Favourable reviews segment. It’s easy because you have nothing else to do but to run it at the speed you want and leave it. Give the filter a vacuum cleaner when it’s needed and that’s essentially the level of maintenance. The compact size has made some people skeptical because they wonder how powerful it really is. On the other hand, the small size is very positive for many people, because it doesn’t swell the room and doesn’t take up the space.</p>
<p>Benefits at a glance: quiet, vacuum, affordable, easy to clean, compact, compact</p>
<h3><span id="Negative">Negative:</span></h3>
<p>The 1 and 2 star segment contains a number of comments about “economic construction” and “bad design” (their words, not ours). Most of these comments are motivated by the combustion of the air purifier after about a month of use or after a broken month. Some users have noticed a rattling sound, but this seems rare, given the many comments that praise tranquillity.</p>
<p>Some people are impressed by the reduction of odors in their home. However, many also said that the odour change is simply not good enough. This model is not defined as an air purifier that eliminates odours, so it is fair that as a specific odour model it cannot provide this service satisfactorily.</p>
<p>If you want to get your air out of the animal’s drifting hairs, you can choose another model. Customers with pets have noticed that this air purifier is not good for capturing hair from pets. Here’s my position on this subject: use your vacuum cleaner using pet hair accessories to keep the hair off your floor. This reduces the need for the air purifier to catch the down.</p>
<p>Another powerful “scam” in the poor part of these exams seems to be the setting of the highest speed too high. This is only a problem if you need to use this setting when you are in the room at exactly the same time. Otherwise just use the lowest setting and you won’t notice a thing.</p>
<p>Opposite sketch: cheap construction, does not stink economically, does not catch animal hair, the next speed is for some too high, does not catch enough dust for a number of tastes.</p>
